== Nexus LDAP Integration

=== Introduction 

Nexus OSS has a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
Authentication realm which provides Nexus with the capability to
authenticate users against an LDAP server.  In addition to handling
authentication, Nexus can be configured to map Nexus roles to LDAP
user groups. If a user is a member of a group that matches the ID of a
Nexus role, Nexus will grant that user the matching Nexus role. In
addition to this highly configurable user and group mapping
capability, Nexus can augment LDAP group membership with
Nexus-specific user-role mapping.

In addition to the basic LDAP support from Nexus OSS, Nexus Pro
offers LDAP support features for enterprise LDAP
deployments. These include the ability to cache authentication information,
support for multiple LDAP servers and backup mirrors, the ability to
test user logins, support for common user/group mapping templates, and
the ability to support more than one schema across multiple servers.

[[ldap-sect-enabling]]
=== Enabling the LDAP Authentication Realm

In order to use LDAP authentication in Nexus, you will need to add the
Nexus LDAP Authentication Realm to the Selected Realms in the Security
section of the Server configuration panel. To load the 'Server'
configuration panel, click on the 'Server' link under 'Administration'
in the 'Nexus' menu. Once you have the 'Server' configuration panel
loaded, select 'Enterprise LDAP Authentication Realm' (or 'OSS LDAP
Authentication Realm') in the 'Available Realms' list under the
'Security Settings' section and click the 'Add' button (or 'Left Arrow') as
shown in <<fig-ldap-selecting-realm>> and ensure that the LDAP realm
is located below the XML realms in the list.

This is necessary, so that Nexus can be used by 'anonymous', 'admin' and
other users configured in the XML realms even with LDAP authentication
offline or unavailable. Any user account not found in the XML realms,
will be passed through to LDAP authentication.

Next, click on the 'Save' button at the bottom of the Server
configuration panel to have the change applied.

[[ldap-sect-configuring]]
=== Configuring Nexus LDAP Integration

To configure LDAP integration, click on the 'Enterprise LDAP' menu item
in Nexus Pro or the 'LDAP Configuration' menu item in Nexus OSS
in the 'Security' menu in the left-hand Nexus menu.

Clicking on the Enterprise LDAP/LDAP Configuration menu item will load
the LDAP Configuration panel. The following sections outline the
configuration options available in the LDAP Configuration Panel.

[[ldap-sect-connect-auth]]
=== Connection and Authentication

<<fig-ldap-connection-authentication>> shows a simplified LDAP
configuration for Nexus configured to connect to an LDAP server
running on localhost port 10389 using the search base of
+ou=system+. On a more standard installation, you would likely not
want to use Simple Authentication as it sends the password in clear
text over the network, and you would also use a search base that
corresponds to your organization's top-level domain components such as
+dc=sonatype,dc=com+.

[[fig-ldap-connection-authentication]]
.A Simple LDAP Connection and Authentication Setup
image::figs/web/ldap_configure_connection_and_authentication.png[scale=60]

The following parameters can be configured in the 'Connection' and
'Authentiation' sections of the 'LDAP Configuration' panel.

Protocol:: Valid values in this drop-down are +ldap+ and +ldaps+ that
correspond to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol and the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over SSL.

Hostname:: The hostname or IP address of the LDAP.

Port:: The port on which the LDAP server is listening. Port 389 is the
default port for the ldap protocol, and port 636 is the default port
for the ldaps.

Search Base:: The search base is the Distinguished Name (DN) to be
appended to the LDAP query. The search base usually corresponds to the
domain name of an organization. For example, the search base on the
Sonatype LDAP server could be +dc=sonatype,dc=com+.

Authentication Method:: Nexus provides four distinct authentication
methods to be used when connecting to the LDAP Server:

Simple Authentication;; Simple authentication is not recommended for
production deployments not using the secure ldaps protocol as it sends
a clear-text password over the network.

Anonymous Authentication;; Used when Nexus only needs read-only access
to non protected entries and attributes when binding to the LDAP.

Digest-MD5;; This is an improvement on the CRAM-MD5 authentication
method. For more information, see 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt].

CRAM-MD5;; The Challenge-Response Authentication Method (CRAM) is based
on the HMAC-MD5 MAC algorithm. In this authentication method, the
server sends a challenge string to the client. The client responds
with a username followed by a Hex digest that the server compares to
an expected value. For more information, see RFC 2195.

For a full discussion of LDAP authentication approaches, see
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2829.txt[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2829.txt] and
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt].

SASL Realm:: The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) realm used
to connect. It is only available if the authentication method is Digest-MD5 
or CRAM-MD5.

Username:: Username of an LDAP user with which to connect (or bind). This is
a 'Distinguished Name' of a user who has read access to all users and
groups.

Password:: Password for an administrative LDAP user.

[[ldap-sect-user-group-mapping]]
=== User and Group Mapping

The 'LDAP Configuration' panel in Nexus OSS contains sections to
manage 'User Element Mapping' and 'Group Element Mapping' in the 'User' and
'Group Settings' tab. These configuration sections are located in a
separate panel called 'User and Group Settings' in Nexus Pro.
This panel provided a 'User & Group Templates' drop-down
displayed in <<fig-ldap-user-group_templates>> that will adjust the
rest of the user interface based on your template selection.

[[fig-ldap-user-group_templates]]
.User and Group Templates Selection Drop Down
image::figs/web/ldap_user_group_templates.png[scale=60]

The User Element Mapping displayed in
<<fig-ldap-user-element-mapping>> has been prepopulated by the Active
Directory selection in the template drop-down and needs to be
configured as required by your LDAP server. The available fields are:

Base DN:: Corresponds to the 'Base DN' containing user entries. This DN
is going to be relative to the 'Search Base', specified in
<<fig-ldap-connection-authentication>>. For example, if your users are
all contained in +ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com+ and you specified a
Search Base of +dc=sonatype,dc=com+, you would use a value of
+ou=users+.

User Subtree:: Values are 'True' if there is a tree below the Base DN that can
contain user entries and 'False' if all users are contain within the
specified Base DN. For example, if all users are in
+ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com+ this field should be 'False'. If users can
appear in organizational units within organizational units such as
+ou=development,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com+, this field should be
'True'.

Object Class:: This value defaults to inetOrgPerson which is a
standard object class defined in
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2798.html[RFC 2798]. This Object Class (inetOrgPerson)
contains standard fields such as 'mail', 'uid'. Other possible values are
'posixAccount' or a custom class.

User ID Attribute:: This is the attribute of the Object class that
supplies the User ID. Nexus will use this attribute as the Nexus User
ID.

Real Name Attribute:: This is the attribute of the Object class that
supplies the real name of the user. Nexus will use this attribute when
it needs to display the real name of a user.

E-Mail Attribute:: This is the attribute of the Object class that
supplies the email address of the user. Nexus will use this attribute
when it needs to send an email to a user.

Password Attribute:: This control is only available in Nexus OSS
and replaced by the 'Use Password Attribute' section from
<<fig-ldap-use-password-attribute>> in Nexus Pro. It can be
used to configure the Object class, which supplies the password
("userPassword").
 
[[fig-ldap-user-element-mapping]]
.User Element Mapping 
image::figs/web/ldap_user_element_mapping.png[scale=60]

Once the checkbox for 'Use Password Attribute' has been selected, the
interface from <<fig-ldap-use-password-attribute>> allows you to
configure the optional attribute. When not configured authentication
will occur as a bind to the LDAP server. Otherwise this is the
attribute of the Object class that supplies the password of the
user. Nexus will use this attribute when it is authenticating a user
against an LDAP server.

[[fig-ldap-use-password-attribute]]
image::figs/web/ldap_use_password_attribute.png[scale=60]

The 'Group Type' drop-down displayed in
<<fig-ldap-group-element-mapping-dynamic>> and
<<fig-ldap-group-element-mapping-static>> determines which fields are
available in the user interface.  Groups are generally one of two
types in LDAP systems - static or dynamic. A static group contains a
list of users. A dynamic group is a list  of
groups to which user belongs. In LDAP a static group would be captured
in an entry with an Object class 'groupOfUniqueNames' that contains one
or more 'uniqueMember' attributes. In a dynamic group configuration,
each user entry in LDAP contains an attribute that lists group
membership.

[[fig-ldap-group-element-mapping-dynamic]]
.Dynamic Group Element Mapping
image::figs/web/ldap_group_element_mapping_dynamic.png[scale=60]

Dynamic groups are configured via the 'Member of Attribute' parameter.
Nexus will inspect this attribute of the user entry to get a list of
groups of which the user is a member. In this configuration, a user
entry would have an attribute that would contain the
name of a group, such as 'memberOf'.

[[fig-ldap-group-element-mapping-static]]
.Static Group Element Mapping
image::figs/web/ldap_group_element_mapping_static.png[scale=60]
 

Static groups are configured with the following parameters:

Base DN:: This field is similar to the Base DN field described for
'User Element Mapping'. If your groups were defined under
+ou=groups,dc=sonatype,dc=com+, this field would have a value of
+ou=groups+.

Group Subtree:: This field is similar to the 'User Subtree' field
described for 'User Element Mapping'. If all groups are defined under
the entry defined in 'Base DN', this field should be false. If a group
can be defined in a tree of organizational units under the Base DN,
then the field should be 'true'.

Object Class:: This value defaults to groupOfUniqueNames which is a
standard object class defined in
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2798.html[RFC 4519]. This default ('groupOfUniqueNames') is
simply a collection of references to unique entries in an LDAP
directory and can be used to associate user entries with a
group. Other possible values are 'posixGroup' or a custom class.

Group ID Attribute:: Specifies the attribute of the Object class that
specifies the 'Group ID'. If the value of this field corresponds to the
ID of a Nexus role, members of this group will have the corresponding
Nexus privileges. Defaults to +cn+. 

Group Member Attribute:: Specifies the attribute of the Object class
which specifies a member of a group. A 'groupOfUniqueNames' has multiple
'uniqueMember' attributes for each member of a group. Defaults to
'uniqueMember'.

Group Member Format:: This field captures the format of the 'Group
Member Attribute', and is used by Nexus to extract a username from
this attribute. For example, if the 'Group Member Attribute' has the
format +uid=brian,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com+, then the 'Group Member
Format' would be +uid=$username,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com+.  If the
'Group Member Attribute' had the format +brian+, then the 'Group Member
Format' would be +$username+.

If your installation does not use Static Groups, you can configure
Nexus LDAP Integration to refer to an attribute on the User entry to
derive group membership. To do this, select Dynamic Groups in the
Group Type field in Group Element Mapping.

Once you have configured the 'User & Group Settings' you can check the
correctness of your user mapping by pressing the 'Check User Mapping'
button visible in <<fig-ldap-group-element-mapping-static>>.

Nexus Pro offers a button 'Check Login' to check an
individual users login and can be used as documented in
<<ldap-sect-testing-user-login>>.

Press the 'Save' button after successful configuration.


[[ldap-sect-mapping-active-directory]]
=== Mapping Users and Groups with Active Directory

When mapping users and groups to an Active Directory
installation, try the common configuration values listed in
<<tbl-ldap-ad-user-element>> and <<tbl-ldap-ad-group-element>>.

.Connection and Authentication Configuration for Active Directory
[cols="2,5",options="header"]

WARNING: You should connect to the Active Directory through port 3268 if you have a
multi domain, distributed Active Directory forest. Connecting directly
to port 389 might lead to errors. Port 3268 exposes Global Catalog
Server that exposes the distributed data. The SSL equivalent
connection port is 3269.

[[ldap-sect-mapping-posix]]
=== Mapping Users and Groups with posixAccount

When mapping users and groups to LDAP entries of type
posixAccount, try the common configuration values listed in
<<tbl-ldap-posix-user-element>> and <<tbl-ldap-posix-group-element>>.

[[tbl-ldap-posix-user-element]]
.User Element Mapping Configuration for posixAccount
[cols="2,5",options="header"]

[[ldap-sect-mapping-roles-ldap]]
=== Mapping Roles to LDAP Users

Once 'User and Group Mapping' has been configured, you can start
verifying how LDAP users and groups are mapped to Nexus roles. If a
user is a member of an LDAP group that has a 'Group ID' corresponding to
the ID of a Nexus role, that user is granted the appropriate
permissions in Nexus. For example, if the LDAP user entry in
+uid=brian,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com+ is a member of a
'groupOfUniqueNames' attribute value of +admin+, when this user logs into
Nexus, he/she will be granted the Nexus administrator role if the 'Group
Element Mapping' is configured properly. To verify the 'User Element
Mapping' and 'Group Element Mapping', click on 'Check User Mapping' in the
'LDAP Configuration' panel directly below the 'Group Element Mapping'
section, <<fig-ldap-verify-user-mapping>> shows the results of this
check.

[[fig-ldap-verify-user-mapping]] 
.Checking the User and Group Mapping in LDAP Configuration
image::figs/web/ldap_verifying_user_mapping.png[scale=60]

In <<fig-ldap-verify-user-mapping>>, Nexus LDAP Integration locates a
user with a User ID of "brian" who is a member of the "admin"
group. When brian logs in, he will have all of the rights that the
admin Nexus Role has.

[[ldap-sect-mapping-nexus-roles-ext]]
=== Mapping Nexus Roles for External Users

If you are unable to map all of the Nexus roles to LDAP groups, you
can always augment the role information by adding a specific user-role
mapping for an external LDAP user in Nexus. In other words, if you
need to make sure that a specific user in LDAP gets a specific Nexus
role and you don't want to model this as a group membership, you can
add a role mapping for an external user in Nexus. 

Nexus will keep track of this association independent of your LDAP
server. Nexus continues to delegate authentication to the LDAP server
for this user. Nexus will continue to map the user to Nexus roles
based on the group element mapping you have configured, but Nexus will
also add any roles specified in the User panel. You are augmenting the
role information that Nexus gathers from the group element mapping.

Once the user and group mapping has been configured, click on the
'Users' link under 'Security' in the Nexus menu. The 'Users' tab is going to
contain all of the configured users for this Nexus instance as shown
in <<fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial>>. A configured user is a
user in a Nexus-managed realm or an 'External User' that has an
explicit mapping to a Nexus role. In
<<fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial>>, you can see the three
default users in the Nexus-managed default realm plus the +brian+ user
from LDAP. The +brian+ user appears because this user has been mapped to
a Nexus role.

[[fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial]] 
.Viewing All Configured Users
image::figs/web/ldap_ad_all_configured_users_initial.png[scale=60]

The list of users in <<fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial>> is a
combination of all of the users in the Nexus default realm and all of
the 'External Users' with role mappings. To explore these two sets of
users, click on the 'All Configured Users' drop-down and choose
'Default Realm Users'. Once you select this, click in the search field
and press Enter. Searching with a blank string in the 'Users' panel will
return all of the users of the selected type. In
<<fig-ldap-all-default-realm>> you see a dialog containing all three
default users from the Nexus default realm.

[[fig-ldap-all-default-realm]]
.All Default Realm Users
image::figs/web/ldap_ad_all_default_realm_users.png[scale=60]

If you wanted to see a list of all LDAP users, select 'LDAP' from the
'All Configured Users' drop-down shown in
<<fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial>> and click on the search
button (magnifying glass) with an empty search field. Clicking search
with an empty search field will return all of the LDAP users as shown
in <<fig-ldap-all-ldap-realm>>.

NOTE: Note that the user +tobrien+ does not show up in the 'All
Configured Users' list. This is by design. Nexus is only going to show
you information about users with external role mappings. If an
organization has an LDAP directory with thousands of developers, Nexus
doesn't need to retain any configuration information for users that
don't have custom Nexus role mappings.

[[fig-ldap-all-ldap-realm]]
.All LDAP Users
image::figs/web/ldap_ad_all_ldap_realm_users.png[scale=60]

To add a mapping for an external LDAP user, you would click on the
'All Configured Users' drop-down and select 'LDAP'. Once you've selected
LDAP, type in the user ID you are searching for and click the search
button (magnifying glass icon to right of the search field). In
<<fig-ldap-search-ldap-users>>, a search for "brian" yields one user
from the LDAP server.

[[fig-ldap-search-ldap-users]]
.Search LDAP Users
image::figs/web/ldap_ad_searching_ldap_users.png[scale=60]

To add a Nexus role mapping for the external user +brian+ shown in
<<fig-ldap-search-ldap-users>>, click on the user in the results table
and drag a role from 'Available Roles' to 'Selected Roles' as shown in
<<fig-ldap-mapping-deploy>>. In this case, the user "brian" is mapped
to the Administrative group by virtue of his membership in an "admin"
group in the LDAP server. In this use case, a Nexus administrator
would like to grant Brian the Deployment Role without having to create
a LDAP group for this role and modifying his group memberships in LDAP

[[fig-ldap-mapping-deploy]] 
.Mapping the Deployment Role to an External User
image::figs/web/ldap_ad_mapping_ldap_deployment.png[scale=60]

The end result of this operation is to augment the Group-Role mapping
that is provided by the LDAP integration. You can use LDAP groups to
manage coarse-grained permissions to grant people administrative
privileges and developer roles, and if you need to perform more
targeted privilege assignments in Nexus you can Map LDAP users to
Nexus roles with the techniques shown in this section.

[[ldap-sect-external-role-mapping-config]]
=== Mapping External Roles to Nexus Roles

Nexus makes it very straightforward to map an external role to an
internal Nexus role. This is something you would do, if you want to
grant every member of an externally managed group (such as an LDAP
group) a certain privilege in Nexus. For example, assume that you have
a group in LDAP named +svn+ and you want to make sure that everyone in
the +svn+ group has Nexus administrative privileges. To do this, you
would click on the 'Add..' drop-down in the 'Roles' panel as shown in
<<fig-ldap-select-ext-role-map>>. This drop-down can be found in the
roles management panel which is opened by clicking on 'Roles' in the
'Security' menu.

[[fig-ldap-select-ext-role-map]] 
.Selecting External Role Mapping in the Role Management Panel
image::figs/web/ldap_mapping-external-role.png[scale=60]

Selecting 'External Role Mapping' under 'Add...' will show you a dialog
containing a drop-down of 'External Realms'. Selecting an external
realm such as LDAP will then bring up a list of roles managed by that
external realm. The dialog shown in <<fig-ldap-select-ext-role>> shows
the external realm LDAP selected and the role "svn" being selected to
map to a Nexus role.

[[fig-ldap-select-ext-role]]
.Selecting an Externally Managed Role to Map to a Nexus Role
image::figs/web/ldap_mapping-external-role-select.png[scale=60]

Once the external role has been selected, Nexus will create a
corresponding Nexus Role. You can then assign other roles to this new
externally mapped role. <<fig-ldap-external-role-config>> shows that
the SVN role from LDAP is being assigned the Nexus Administrator
Role. This means that any user that is authenticated against the
external LDAP Realm who is a member of the svn LDAP group will be
assigned a Nexus role that maps to the Nexus Administrator Role.

[[fig-ldap-external-role-config]]

[[ldap-sect-enterprise]]
=== Enterprise LDAP Support

The following sections outline Enterprise LDAP features
available in Nexus Pro.  

==== Enterprise LDAP Fail-over Support 

When an LDAP server fails, the applications authenticating
against it can also become unavailable. Because a central LDAP server
is such a critical resource, many large software enterprises will
install a series of primary and secondary LDAP servers to make sure
that the organization can continue to operate in the case of an
unforeseen failure. Nexus Pro's Enterprise LDAP plugin now
provides you with the ability to define multiple LDAP servers for
authentication. To configure multiple LDAP servers, click on
Enterprise LDAP under Security in the Nexus application menu. You
should see the Enterprise LDAP panel shown in the following figure.

.Defining Multiple LDAP Servers in Nexus Pro
image::figs/web/multiple-ldap-servers.png[scale=60]

You can use the 'Backup Mirror' setting for an LDAP repository. This
backup mirror is another LDAP server that will be consulted if the
original LDAP server cannot be reached. Nexus Pro assumes
that the backup mirror is a carbon copy of the original LDAP server,
and it will use the same user and group mapping configuration as the
original LDAP server.  Instead of using the backup mirror settings,
you could also define multiple LDAP backup mirrors in the list of
configured LDAP servers shown in the previous figure. When you
configure more than one LDAP server, Nexus Pro will consult
the servers in the order they are listed in this panel. If Nexus can't
authenticate against the first LDAP server, Nexus Pro will
move on to the next LDAP server until it either reaches the end of the
list or finds an LDAP server to authenticate against.  

.Use Multiple LDAP Servers in a Fail-over Scenario 
image::figs/web/ldap-backup.png[scale=60]

The feature just described is one way to increase the reliability of
your Nexus instance. In the previous case, both servers would have the
same user and group information. The secondary would be a mirror of
the primary. But, what if you wanted to connect to two LDAP servers
that contained different data?

If you want to connect to two LDAP servers that contain different data, 
Nexus Pro also provides support for multiple servers and LDAP schemas
as described in <<ldap-multiple>>.

[[ldap-multiple]]
==== Support for Multiple Servers and LDAP Schemas

The same ability to list more than one LDAP server also allows you
to support multiple LDAP servers that may or may not contain the same
user authentication information. Assume that you had an LDAP server for
the larger organization containing all of the user information
across all of the departments. Now assume that your own department
maintains a separate LDAP server that you use to supplement this larger
LDAP installation. Maybe your department needs to create new users that
are not a part of the larger organization, or maybe you have to support
the integration of two separate LDAP servers that use different schema
on each server.

A third possibility is that you need to support authentication
against different schema within the same LDAP server. This is a common
scenario for companies that have merged and whose infrastructures have
not yet been merged. To support multiple servers with different
user/group mappings or to support a single server with multiple
user/group mappings, you can configure these servers in the Enterprise
LDAP panel shown above. Nexus will iterate through each LDAP server
until it can successfully authenticate a user against an LDAP
server.

.Supporting Multiple LDAP Schemas with Nexus Pro
image::figs/web/ldap-multiple.png[scale=60]

==== Enterprise LDAP Performance Caching and Timeout

If you are constantly authenticating against a large LDAP server,
you may start to notice a significant performance degradation. With
Nexus Pro you can cache authentication information from LDAP.
To configure caching, create a new server in the Enterprise LDAP panel,
and scroll to the bottom of the Connect tab. You should see the
following input field which contains the number of seconds to cache the
results of LDAP queries.

.Setting the LDAP Query Cache Duration (in Seconds)
image::figs/web/ldap-caching.png[scale=60]

You will also see options to alter the connection timeout and
retry interval for an LDAP server. If you are configuring a number of
different LDAP servers with different user and group mappings, you will
want to make sure that you've configured low timeouts for LDAP servers
at the beginning of your Enterprise LDAP server list. If you do this
properly, it will take Nexus next to no time to iterate through the list
of configured LDAP servers.

.Setting the LDAP Connection Timeout (in Seconds)
image::figs/web/ldap-timeout.png[scale=60]

We improved the overall caching in this release. The cache duration is
configurable and applies to authentication and authorization, which
translates into pure speed! Once you've configured LDAP caching in
Nexus Pro, authentication and other operations that involve
permissions and credentials once retrieved from an external server
will run in no time.

==== User and Group Templates

If you are configuring your Nexus Pro instance to connect
to an LDAP server there is a very good chance that your server follows
one of several, well-established standards. Nexus Pro's LDAP
server configuration includes these widely used user and group mapping
templates that great simplify the setup and configuration of a new LDAP
server. To configure user and group mapping using a template, select a
LDAP server from the Enterprise LDAP panel, and choose the User and
Group Settings. You will see a User &amp; Group Templates section as
shown in the following figure.

.Using User and Group Mapping Templates
image::figs/web/ldap-templates.png[scale=60]

[[ldap-sect-testing-user-login]]
==== Testing a User Login

Nexus Pro provides you with the ability to test a user
login directly. To test a user login, go to the User and Group Settings
tab for a server listed in the Enterprise LDAP panel. Scroll to the
 bottom of the form, and you should see a button named "Check
Login".

.Testing a User Login
image::figs/web/ldap-check-login.png[scale=60]

If you click on Check Login, you will then be presented with the
login credentials dialog shown below. You can use this dialog to login
as an LDAP user and test the user and group mapping configuration for a
particular server. This feature allows you to test user and group
mapping configuration directly and to quickly
diagnose and address difficult authentication and access control issues
via the administrative interface.
