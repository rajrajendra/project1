== Improved Releases with Nexus Staging

[[staging-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

If you release software, you will often need to test a release before
deploying it to a production system or an externally accessible
repository. For example, if you are developing a large, enterprise web
application, you may want to stage a release candidate to a staging
system and perform a series of rigorous tests before a release manager
makes a decision to either return a system to development or deploy a
system to production.

The staging suite in Nexus Pro allows an organization
to create a temporary staging repository and to manage the promotion
of components from a staging repository to a release repository. This
ability to create an isolated, release candidate repository that can be
discarded or promoted makes it possible to support the decisions that
go into certifying a release, while the certification process is done
on the same binaries that will ultimately be released.

[[staging-sect-without]]
==== Releasing Software without a Staging Repository

Without the staging suite, when a developer deploys a component to a
hosted repository such as the release repository, this component is
published and immediately made available, having no oversight, no 
process and no certification process. There is no chance to
test the component before writing the component to a hosted
repository. If there is a mistake in the release, often the only
option available is to republish the components to the release
repository or deploy a new version of the components.

While this is acceptable for some users, organizations and enterprises
with a QA cycle often need a temporary storage for potential release
candidates: a staging repository. With the Nexus staging suite, an
organization can automatically stage releases to a temporary
repository that can then be used to test and certify a set of
components, before they are published to a final release
repository. This temporary repository can then be promoted as a whole
or dropped, depending on the results of testing. When used, the binary
components being tested and certified are the identical components that
will ultimately be released. You will not have a clean fresh build kicked off
after the certification finished, as is often the case without a
staging suite being used.

[[staging-sect-how]]
==== How the Staging Suite Works

Here's how staging works in Nexus Pro:

. A developer deploys a component (or a set of components) to Nexus Pro.

. The staging suite intercepts this deployment and determines if the
deployment matches for a staging profile. 

. If a match is found, a temporary staging repository is created and
the components are deployed to this repository.

. Once the developer has deployed a set of components to Nexus, they
will then "Close" the staging repository.

. The Staging Suite will then add this temporary staging repository to
one or more Target Repository Groups.

Once the staging repository is closed and has been added to a target
repository group, the components in the staging repository are
available to Nexus users for testing and certification via a
repository group. Tests can be performed on the components as if they
were already published in a hosted repository. At this point different
actions can be performed with the staging repository:

Release:: A Nexus user can "release" a staging repository and select a
hosted repository to which to publish components. Releasing the contents of a
repository publishes all components from the staging repository to a
hosted repository and deletes the temporary staging repository.

Drop:: A Nexus user can "drop" a staging repository. Dropping a
staging repository will remove it from any groups and delete the
temporary staging repository.

Promote:: If your Nexus installation contains Build Promotion
profiles, you will also see an option to "promote" a staging
repository to a Build Promotion Group. When you promote a staging
repository you expose the contents of that staging repository via
additional groups. Build Promotion profiles are explained in detail in
the next section.

[[staging-configuration]]
=== Configuring the Nexus Staging Suite

==== Overview

The Staging Suite is part of the default Nexus Pro install
and is accessible with the menu items 'Staging Profiles', 'Staging
Repositories', 'Staging Ruleset', and 'Staging Upload' options in the
left-hand navigation menu of the Nexus interface called 'Build
Promotion'.

'Staging Profiles' define the rules by which component deployments from
your project are intercepted by Nexus and staged in 'Staging
Repositories'. 

'Staging Repositories' are dynamically created by Nexus as they are
needed. They are temporary holding repositories for your components
that are used for the different staging related steps. Using them in
the Nexus user interface, users can promote the contents of the
staging repository to a hosted repository, discard them, and perform 
other tasks.

'Staging Rulesets' allow you to define rules that the components being
deployed have to follow in order to allow successful deployment. 

'Staging Upload' allows you to manually upload components to Nexus via
the user interface rather than by using your build system.

[[staging-profiles]]
==== Configuring a Staging Profile

Staging profiles control the process by which components are selected
for staging. When you define a Staging profile, you are defining a set
of rules which will control the way in that Nexus intercepts an
component deployment and what actions to perform during and after
staging the components. When you click on 'Staging Profiles' in the 'Nexus'
menu, you will see a list of configured staging profiles. This list
allows you to 'Add...' and 'Delete' staging profiles. Click on an
existing staging profile in the list and the panel below the list will
display the configuration of the profile.

The list of staging profiles displayed also determines the order in
which the profiles are examined when a component is deployed to
staging. Going down the list each profile is checked for a match of
the deployed component characteristics to the configuration of the
profile. If a match is found a staging repository for this profile
with the deployed components is created. Otherwise the next profile in
the list is examined. Specifically with implicit matching criteria
being used for your deployments as explained in more detail below,
this order becomes important and can be controlled by selecting a
staging profile and using the 'Move Up' and 'Move Down' buttons on the
top of the list. Once you have created the desired order, press the
'Save Order' button and confirm the order in the dialog.

Clicking on 'Add...' will display the drop-down menu shown in
<<fig-staging-add-staging-profile>>.

[[fig-staging-add-staging-profile]]
.Adding a Staging Profile
image::figs/web/staging_add-staging-profile.png[scale=60]

Selecting 'Staging Profile' will create a new staging profile and
display the form shown in <<fig-staging-edit-profile>>.

<<fig-staging-edit-profile>> defines a staging profile named +Test+.
It is configured to only intercept explicit deployments in the
'Profile Selection Strategy' using the 'Profile ID' and the Nexus
Staging Maven Plugin. It uses the template 'Maven2 (hosted, release)'
for newly created temporary staging repositories, and it will
automatically add closed staging repositories to the 'Public
Repositories' group. In addition, it is configured to verify the
deployment against the rules defined in Nexus Lifecycle for the 'CLM
Application Id' +bom1-12345678+.

[[fig-staging-edit-profile]]
.Creating a New Staging Profile
image::figs/web/staging-profile-edit.png[scale=60]

The form allows you to configure a profile with the following fields:

Profile ID and Deploy URL:: These two fields are displayed as "read only" once 
a profile has been created. The Profile ID displays the unique identifier 
that can be used for staging to this
repository using the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin. The Deploy URL
displays the generic staging URL that can be used with the default
Maven Deploy Plugin together with the Repository Target configuration
to intercept the deployment and move the components into the Staging
Suite instead.

Profile Name:: The name of the staging profile. This can be an arbitrary
value. It is simply a convenience for the Nexus Administrator, and
it is also used to create Nexus roles that are used to grant
permissions to view and manipulate staging repositories created by
this profile.

Profile Selection Strategy:: Select the strategy used by Nexus to
select this staging profile. +Explicit or Implicit+ is the default
behavior and causes Nexus to select the profile by the provided
staging profile identifier and to fall back to an automatice determination, 
if none is provided. It is necessary to be used with
the Maven deploy plugin and the correct staging profile is determined
using repository targets together with the generic deploy URL of Nexus.
+
When using the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin for deployments, and
therefore an explicitly defined staging profile in the project POM, the
setting should be changed to +Explicit Only+. This will prevent the
profile from implicitly capturing a deployment in this repository due
to the matching defined and allow Nexus to ensure that the deployment
reaches the staging profile with the configured staging profile ID,
even if the default matching and staging profile order could
potentially cause a deployment to end up in a different profile.

Searchable Repositories:: The default value of enabling this
feature will cause any new components in this staging profile to be
added to the indexes and therefore be available in search
queries. Disable this feature to "hide" components in staging.

Staging Mode:: This field contains the options +Deploy+, +UI Upload+, 
and +Deploy and UI Upload+. This controls how components can be staged
to this staging profile. If Deploy is selected, components can only be
deployed using Maven to upload build components. If UI Upload is
selected, users can upload components to Nexus using the Nexus user
interface.

Template:: Defines the template for the format of the temporary
staging repositories created by this staging profile. The current
version of Nexus Pro provides the option +Maven2 (hosted,
release)+ only. Additional templates can be supplied by plugins that
enable staging for other repository types. An example for such a
plugin is the http://code.google.com/p/nexus-yum-plugin/[Nexus Yum
Plugin].

Repository Target:: When a developer deploys a component to the
generic Deploy URL, the Staging Suite will check to see if the
component matches the patterns defined in this Repository Target. The
repository target defines the "trigger" for the creation of a staging
repository from this staging profile and is only needed for implicit
deployments with the Deploy URL and not for explicit deployments using
the Profile ID.

Release Repository:: Staged components are stored in a temporary
staging repository that is made available via Target Groups. Once a
staged deployment has been successfully tested, components contained in
the temporary staging repository are promoted to a hosted repository
as their final storage place. The Release Repository setting
configures this target release repository for this staging profile.

CLM Application Id:: Configure the application identifier defined in the
Nexus Lifecycle server to allow to use of the rules defined there for 
staging within Nexus. More details can be found in <<staging-clm>>.

Content Type:: Nexus can create staging repositories for repositories
of type Maven2. This value is automatically selected based on the chosen
template. 

Target Groups:: When a Staging Repository is 'closed' and is made
available to users and developers involved in the testing process, the
temporary Staging Repository is added to one or more Repository
Groups. This field defines those groups. It is a best practice to
create a separate group, different from the group typically used for
development like the default 'Public Repositories' group for
staging. This prevents the staged components from leaking to all users
and allows you to control access to the them via security settings for
the separate repository group. In many cases mulitple target groups
can be useful for different user groups to have access.

Close Repository Notification Settings:: After a developer has
deployed a set of related release components, a staging repository is
'closed'. This means that no further components can be deployed to the
same staging repository.  A repository would be closed when a
developer is satisfied that a collection of staged components is ready
to be certified by a manager or a quality assurance resource. In this
setting, it is possible to define email addresses and roles that
should be notified of a staging repository being closed. A
notification email will be sent to all specified email addresses, as
well as all Nexus users in the specified roles, informing them that a
staging repository has been closed. It is also possible to select that
the creator of the staging repository receives this notification.

Promote Repository Notification Settings:: Once a closed staging
repository has been certified by whomever is responsible for testing
and checking a staged release, it can then be promoted (published) or
dropped (discarded). In this setting, it is possible to define the email
addresses and Nexus security roles that should be notified of a
staging repository being promoted. A notification email will be sent
to all specified email addresses, as well as all Nexus users in the
specified roles, informing them that a staging repository has been
promoted. It is also possible to select that the creator of the
staging repository receives this notification.

Drop Repository Notification Settings:: In this setting, it is
possible to define email addresses and roles notified when 
a staging repository is being dropped.  A notification email will be sent
to all specified email addresses, as well as all Nexus users in the
specified roles, informing them that a staging repository has been
dropped. It is also possible to select that the creator of the staging
repository receives this notification.
           
Close Repository Staging Rulesets:: This defines the rulesets 
applied to a staging repository before it can be closed. If
the staging repository does not pass the rules defined in the
specified rulesets, you will be unable to close it. For more
information about rulesets, see <<staging-sect-rulesets>>.

Promote Repository Staging Rulesets:: This defines the rulesets 
applied to a staging repository on promotion. If the staging
repository does not pass the rules defined in the specified rulesets,
the promotion will fail with an error message supplied by the failing
rule. For more information about rulesets, see
<<staging-sect-rulesets>>.


[[staging-build-promotion-profile]]
==== Configuring Build Promotion Profiles

A build promotion profile is used when you need to add an additional
step between initial staging and final release. To add a new 'Build
Promotion' profile, open the 'Staging Profiles' link from the 'Nexus' menu
and click on 'Add...' to display the drop-down menu shown in
<<fig-staging-build-promo-link>>. Select 'Build Promotion Profile' from
this drop-down to create a new build promotion profile.

[[fig-staging-build-promo-link]]
.Multilevel Staging and Build Promotion
image::figs/web/staging-build-promotion-profile-add.png[scale=60]

After creating a new build promotion profile, you will see the
form shown in <<fig-staging-build-promo-profile>>. This
form contains the following configuration fields:

Profile Name:: The name for the build promotion profile displayed in 
the promotion dialog and  associated with repositories created from 
this promotion profile.

Template:: The template for repositories generated by this
build promotion profile. The default value for this field is +Maven2
(group)+.

Target Groups:: The 'Target Groups' field is is the most important 
configuration field for a build promotion profile, as it controls the 
group through which promoted components are made available. Components 
can be made available through one or more groups.

[[staging-security]]
==== Staging Related Security Setup

Staging Suite is controlled by three roles:

- Staging: Deployer
- Staging: Promoter
- Staging: Repositories

These roles are available as general 'admin' roles that apply to all
staging profiles with the respective access. When you create a new
staging profile, Nexus will create new roles that grant permissions
specific to that staging profile. If you created the staging profile
named +Test+, Nexus created the three new and profile-specific roles:

Staging: Repositories (Test):: This role grants a user read and view
access to the staging repositories created by the 'Test' staging
profile.
 
Staging: Deployer (Test):: This role grants all of the privileges from
the Staging: Repositories role and, in addition, grants the user
permission to deploy components, close and drop any staging repository
created by the 'Test' staging profile.

Staging: Promoter (Test):: This role grants the user to right to
promote staging repositories created by the 'Test' staging profile.

To perform a staged deployment, the user deploying the component must
have the 'Staging: Deployer (admin)' role or the 'Staging: Deployer'
role for a specific staging profile.

To configure the deployment user with the appropriate staging role,
click on Users under the 'Security' menu in the 'Nexus' menu. Once you see
the 'Users' panel , click on the deployment user to edit this user's
roles. Click on the 'Add' button in the 'Role Management' section of the
'Config' tab visible in <<fig-staging-user-add-role>> for the user to be
able to add new roles to the user.


[[fig-staging-user-add-role]]
.Adding a Role to a User 
image::figs/web/staging-user-add-role.png[scale=60]

Use the 'Filter' section with the keyword +Staging+ and press the 'Apply
 Filter' button to see all available staging-related roles as displayed
 in <<fig-staging-user-add-role>>.

[[fig-staging-user-add-role-dialog]]
.Available Roles for Staging with a Test Staging Profile 
image::figs/web/staging-user-add-role-dialog.png[scale=50]

You should see the "Staging: Deployer (admin)" role listed as well as
the 'Test' staging profile-specific role, the promoter and
repositories ones for 'admin' and 'Test' and a few staging user
interface related roles. These roles are required if interaction with
the staging suite in the Nexus user interface is desired and allow you
to control the details about this access. If you need to add a
specific permission to activate a single Staging Profile, you would
select that specific role.

Once the deployment user has the "Staging: Deployer (admin)" role, you
can then use this user to deploy to the staging URL and trigger any
staging profile. Without this permission, the deployment user would
not be able to publish a staged component. 

In a similar fashion, you can assign the promoter role to users.

In addition to the roles created a number of specific privileges is
available to further customize the access to the staging suite: 

Staging Profiles:: Allows control of create, read, delete and update
operations on staging profiles.

Staging Repository: test-001:: There are separate privileges for each staging
repository allowing create, read, update and delete operations are
generated automatically.

Staging: All Profiles, Owner All Profiles  and Profile xyz:: These
staging profile specific-privileges can be granted for drop, promote,
read and finish operations.

Staging: Rule Set and Staging: Rule Types:: Control access to staging
rules and rule types

Staging: Upload:: controls access to the manual staging upload user interface

Staging: Repositories, Promote Repository, Profile Ordering, Close Staging and others::
A number of application user interface-specific privileges allow fine-grained 
control over access in the user interface.

==== Using Repository Targets for Staging 

The Staging Suite intercepts deployments to Nexus using Repository
Targets as documented in <<repository-targets>> when
using implicit matching as a profile selection strategy, based on the
components path in the repository.

For example, if you wanted to intercept all deployments to the
com.sonatype.sample groupId, you would create a repository target
with a pattern with a regular expression of
`^/com/sonatype/sample/.*` and use that repository target in your
Staging Profile configuration.

[[staging-deployment]]
=== Configuring Your Project for Deployment

Once Nexus is configured to receive components in the staging suite as
documented in <<staging-configuration>>, you will have to update
your project build configuration to deploy to the staging suite.

The preferred way to do this is to take advantage of the features
provided by the Nexus staging Maven plugin or the Nexus staging Ant
tasks  as documented in
<<staging-maven>>
and <<staging-ant>>.

If you need to continue to use the Maven deploy plugin, you can read
about using it with the Nexus staging suite in 
<<staging-deployment-maven-deploy-plugin>>. 

With all tools you can use the manual upload of your components
documented in <<staging-deployment-manual>>.

[[staging-maven]]
==== Deployment with the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin

The Nexus staging Maven plugin is a Nexus specific and more powerful
replacement for the Maven deploy Plugin with a number of features
specifically geared towards usage with the Nexus staging suite. The
simplest usage can be configured by adding it to the project build plugins
section as an extension:

----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.sonatype.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>nexus-staging-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.6.3</version>
      <extensions>true</extensions>
      <configuration>
        <serverId>nexus</serverId>
        <nexusUrl>http://localhost:8081/nexus/</nexusUrl>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
----

NOTE: It is important to use a version of the plugin that is
compatible with your Nexus server. Version 1.2 is compatible with
Nexus 2.3, Version 1.4.4 is compatible with Nexus 2.4, Version 1.4.8
is compatible with Nexus 2.5 and 2.6. 1.5 and 1.6.x can be used for
Nexus 2.7 to 2.10. The latest version of the plugin available is
always compatible with the latest available version of Nexus. Try to
use the newest possible plugin version to take advantage of any
available improvements.

Following Maven best practices, the version should be pulled out into a
+pluginManagement+ section in a company POM or parent POM.

This configuration works only in Maven 3 and automatically replaces
the deploy goal invocation of the Maven deploy plugin in the deploy
Maven life cycle phase with the deploy goal invocation of the Nexus
staging Maven plugin. 

The minimal required configuration parameters for the Nexus staging
Maven plugin are:

serverId:: The +id+ of the +server+ element in +settings.xml+ from which
the user credentials for accessing Nexus should be retrieved. 
nexusUrl:: The base URL at which the Nexus server to be used for
staging is available.

With this configuration the Nexus staging Maven plugin will stage the
components locally and connect to Nexus. Nexus will try to determine
the appropriate staging profile by matching the component path with any
repository targets configured with staging profiles with an activated
implicit profile selection strategy. If an appropriate staging profile
is found, a staging repository is created on the fly and the components
are deployed into it. If no profile is found, the upload will fail.

To successfully deploy to your Nexus instance, you will
need to update your Maven Settings with the credentials for the
deployment user. These credentials are stored in the Maven Settings file
in ~/.m2/settings.xml. 

To add these credentials, add the following element to the servers
element in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file as shown in
<<ex-staging-deployment-credentials>>.

[[ex-staging-deployment-credentials]]
.Listing deployment credentials in Maven Settings
----
<settings>
  ...
  <servers>
    ...
    <server>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <username>deployment</username>
      <password>deployment123</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
  ...
</settings>
----

Note that the server identifier listed in
<<ex-staging-deployment-credentials>> should match the serverId
parameter you are passing to the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin and in the
example contains the default password for the Nexus deployment user -
deployment123.  You should change this password to match the
deployment password for your Nexus installation.

If more control is desired over when the plugins deploy goal is
activated or if Maven 2 is used, you have to explicitly deactivate the
Maven Deploy Plugin and replace the Maven Deploy Plugin invocation
with the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin like visible in
in <<fig-staging-maven2and3>>.

            <goal>deploy</goal> 
          </goals> 
        </execution> 
      </executions> 
      <configuration> 
        <serverId>nexus</serverId>
        <nexusUrl>http://localhost:8081/nexus/</nexusUrl>
        <!-- explicit matching using the staging profile id -->
        <stagingProfileId>129341e09f2ee275</stagingProfileId>
      </configuration> 
    </plugin>
...
----

The implicit matching relies on the setup of repository targets as
well as the correct order of staging profiles and is therefore an
error prone approach when many staging profiles are in use. 

The preferred way to work in this sceneario is to change the profile
selection strategy on all staging profiles to explicit only and pass
the staging profile ID to the Nexus staging Maven plugin using the
+stagingProfileId+ configuration parameter as documented above. A full
example +pom.xml+ for deployment of snapshot as well as release builds
with the Nexus staging Maven plugin using explicit matching for the
staging profile and locally staged builds and atomic uploads is
available in <<fig-staging-example-pom>>.

      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
----

In order to deploy project components to Nexus with the above setup you
would invoke a build with +mvn clean deploy+.

The build will locally stage the components for deployment in
+target/nexus-staging+ on the console and create a closed staging 
repository in Nexus holding the build components. This execution of the +deploy+
goal of the Nexus staging Maven plugin performs the following actions:

- Components are staged locally. 

- A staging profile is selected either implicitly or explicitly.

- A staging repository is either created on the fly, if needed, or just
  selected.

- An atomic upload to the staging repository is performed.

- The staging repository is closed (or dropped if upload fails).

The log of a successful deployment would look similar to this:

Instead of Nexus creating a staging repository based on the implicit
or explicit staging profile selection, you can explicitly configure
the staging repository to use by providing the staging repository name
as value of the `stagingRepositoryId` configuration property via the
plugin configuration or command line invocation. 

The identifier of a staging repository can be determined by looking at
the name column in the list of staging repositories. The name column
used the capitalized ID and adds the username and address the staging
was deployed from in brackets. For example a name could be 
`Test-003 (u: admin, a: 127.0.0.1)`. The ID of this staging repository
is `test-003`.

Together with skipping the closing of the repository using
`skipStagingRepositoryClose`, it is possible to get multiple builds to
deploy to the same staging repository and, therefore, have a number of
components go through the staging workflow together. An alternative to
this approach would be to create an aggregating project that assembles
all components together, e.g., in an assembly and then use this project
for staging.


Finally to override all staging, you can define the full repository URL to
deploy to with the `deployUrl` configuration parameter. For example, see below:

---- 
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases/
----

This would cause any staging to be skipped and a straight upload of
the components to the repository to occur.

As part of the configuration section for the plugin you can define
tags with arbitrary key and value names. For example, you could create
a tag with key localUsername and a value of the current user picked up
from the USER environment variable:

----
...
<configuration>
...  
  <tags>
    <localUsername>${env.USER}</localUsername>
    <javaVersion>${java.version}</javaVersion>
  </tags>
...
----


Once components are released these tags are transformed into attributes
stored along the components in the release repository and  can be
accessed via the REST interface and, therefore, any plugin and user
interface integration. 

In addition to the above documented configuration options that
determine the behvaiour of the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin, further
configuration can be provided with the following parameters:

altStagingDirectory:: Defaulting to target/nexus-staging you can
set the property to set a different folder for the local staging.
 
autoReleaseAfterClose:: If you set this flag to +true+, the staging
repository will be closed and, following a
successful validation of all staging rules including potential
Nexus Lifecycle based validation, released. By default this property is
set to +false+. Changing it to +true+ can be a useful setup for
continuous integration server based releases.

description:: Allows you to provide a description for the staging
repository action (like close or drop) carried out as part of the plugin
execution. The description will then be used in any notification just
like a description provided in the user interface.

keepStagingRepositoryOnFailure:: Setting this flag to true will cause
the plugin to skip any clean up operations like dropping a staging
repository for failed uploads, by default these clean up operations
occur. 

keepStagingRepositoryOnCloseRuleFailure:: With the default setting of
+false+, the Nexus staging Maven plugin will drop the created staging
repository if any staging rule violation occurs. If this flag is set
to +true+, it will not drop the staging repository. This allows you to
inspect the deployed components in order to figure out why a rule
failed causing the staging failure.

skipStagingRepositoryClose:: Set this to +true+ to turn off the
automatic closing of a staging repository after deployment.

skipNexusStagingDeployMojo:: Set to +false+ by default, this flag will
cause to skip any execution of the 'deploy' goal of the plugin when
set to true similar to 'maven.deploy.skip'

skipStaging:: Set to +false+ by default this flag will cause to skip any
execution of the plugin when set to true.

skipRemoteStaging:: If this flag is set to +true+ any step related to
remote staging will be skipped and only local staging will be
performed. The default setting is +false+.

skipLocalStaging:: When ++true++, bypass all staging specific features.
Remote deploys happen inline at deploy phase of each module, not at
build end. The deployment repository is "sourced" from pom.xml 
<distributionManagement>. Which distribution repository is used depends
on the project having a release or snapshot version. Essentially this
option makes the staging plugin execution act like the default
'maven-deploy-plugin'. The default setting is +false+.

stagingProgressTimeoutMinutes:: Defaulting to 5 minutes, this
configuration allows you to set the timeout for staging
operations. Changes are most often required for complex staging operations
involving custom staging rules or Nexus Lifecycle integration.

stagingProgressPauseDurationSeconds:: The default of 3 seconds can be
changed if larger pauses between progress polls for staging operations
are desired.

With +skipRemoteStaging+ set to +true+, only the local staging
happens. This local staging can then be picked up for the remote
staging and closing by running the `deploy-staged` goal of the plugin
explicitly like this

----
mvn nexus-staging:deploy-staged
----

Besides the default +deploy+ goal the Nexus staging Maven plugin
supports a number of additional goals. By configuring executions of
the goals as part of your POM or manually invoking them further
automation of a staged release process can be achieved.

deploy-staged:: Perform full staging deployment workflow for a locally
staged project, e.g., with the components in +target/nexus-staging+.

deploy-staged-repository:: Perform an upload of a repository from the
local filesystem to a staging repository.

close:: Close the staging repository for current context.

drop:: Drop the staging repository for current context.

release:: Release the staging repository for current context.

promote:: Promote the staging repository for the current context.

Closing, dropping, and releasing the staging repository using the goals
relies on content of a local staging folder .

Promoting additionally needs the build promotion profile name passed in
via the `buildPromotionProfileId` configuration parameter.

The +deploy-staged-repository+ goal can be used to stage a
repository. Typically, a local repository is created with an invocation
of the deploy similar to 

----
mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=local::default::file://path
----  

To deploy this file system repository with the goal, you have to
provide the path to this repository with the 'repositoryDirectory'
parameter as well as 'nexusUrl', 'serverId' and
'stagingProfileId'. Optionally you can configure the repository to
stage into with 'stagingRepositoryId'. This aggregated command is then
be run outside any specific Maven project.

While the above goals need the context of a project with configuration
for the Nexus Staging Plugin in the POM file, it is possible to
execute staging repository-related tasks without a project as
well. The Nexus Staging Maven Plugin offers remote-control goals to
control staging in Nexus:

rc-close:: Close a specified staging repository.

rc-drop:: Drop a specified staging repository.

rc-release:: Release a specified staging repository. 

rc-promote:: Promote a specified staging repository.

rc-list:: List all staging repositories.

When invoking these goals outside a project context, you need to have
the Nexus staging Maven plugin +groupId+ specified as a +pluginGroup+ in
your +settings.xml+:

----
<pluginGroups>
  <pluginGroup>org.sonatype.plugins</pluginGroup>
</pluginGroups>
----

In addition, you need to specify all parameters on the command line as
properties passed in via +-Dkey=value+.

At a minimum the required parameters `serverId` and `nexusUrl` have to
be specified:
----
 mvn nexus-staging:rc-close -DserverId=nexus -DnexusUrl=http://localhost:8081/nexus
---- 

Depending on the goal you will have to configure the staging
repositories you want to close, drop or release with

----
 -DstagingRepositoryId=repo-001,repo-002
----

and you can also supply a description like this

----
-DstagingDescription="Dropping since QA of issue 123 failed"
----

For promoting, you need to add the required parameter that specifies
the build promotion profile identifier:

----
-DbuildPromotionProfileId=12a25eabf8c8b3f2
----

A successful remote control drop would be logged in the command line
similar to this

---- 
— nexus-staging-maven-plugin:1.2:rc-drop (default-cli) @ standalone-pom —
[INFO] Connecting to Nexus...
[INFO] Using server credentials with ID="nexus-releases" from Maven settings.
[INFO] RC-Dropping staging repository with IDs=[test-003]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

An example  usage of the +rc-list+ goal with output is 
----
$mvn nexus-staging:rc-list -DnexusUrl=http://localhost:8081/nexus
-DserverId=nexus
...
[INFO] --- nexus-staging-maven-plugin:1.5.1:rc-list (default-cli) @ standalone-pom ---

WARNING: The Nexus Maven Plugin in versions earlier than 2.1.0 had goals
to work with staging repositories. These goals have been deprecated in
favour of the remote control goals of the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin.

[[staging-ant]]
==== Deployment with the Nexus Staging Ant Tasks

The Nexus staging Ant tasks provide equivalent features to the Nexus
staging Maven plugin for Apache Ant users covering all use cases for
interacting with the Nexus staging suite.

Historically Ant builds typically have components that are required
for the build, statically managed in the version control system or
even outside the project workspace altogether. More modern Ant builds
use Apache Ivy or Eclipse Aether for resolving dependencies
dynamically as well as deployment build outputs to a repository
manager. Examples projects setups using Ivy as well as Aether can be
found in the 
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples[Nexus book examples project]. 
This project includes examples for integration with the Nexus staging Ant tasks.

To use the Ant tasks in your Ant build file, download the
complete JAR with the included dependencies from the Central Repository. 
Simply search for 'nexus-staging-ant-tasks'
and download the JAR file with the `uber` classifier
e.g., `nexus-staging-ant-tasks-1.6-2-uber.jar`.

After downloading, put the JAR file somewhere in your
project or in your system so you can add it to the classpath in your
build file with a task definition. In the following example, the JAR
file is placed in a  +tasks+ folder within the project.

----
<taskdef uri="antlib:org.sonatype.nexus.ant.staging" 
         resource="org/sonatype/nexus/ant/staging/antlib.xml">
  <classpath>
    <fileset dir="tasks" includes="nexus-staging-ant-tasks-*uber.jar" />
  </classpath>
</taskdef>
----

To enable the tasks in your build file using a shortcut for the
namespace, e.g., +staging+, you have to add it to the +project+ node:

----
<project xmlns:staging="antlib:org.sonatype.nexus.ant.staging" ...>
----

The deployment-related information for your project is captured in a
+nexusStagingInfo+ section in your build file that contains all the
necessary configuration.

----
<staging:nexusStagingInfo id="target-nexus" 
    stagingDirectory="target/local-staging">
  <staging:projectInfo groupId="org.sonatype.nexus.ant"
      artifactId="nexus-staging-ant-tasks"
      version="1.0" />
  <staging:connectionInfo 
      baseUrl="http://localhost:8081/nexus">
    <staging:authentication 
      username="deployment" 
      password="deployment123" />
  </staging:connectionInfo>
</staging:nexusStagingInfo>
----

nexusStagingInfo:id:: The identifier that allows you to reference the
staging information in the Ant build file.

stagingInfo:stagingDirectory:: The local staging directory, a place
where local staging will happen. Ensure that this directory is cleaned
up by a +clean+ task or alike, if any.

projectInfo:: The project information targetting a staging
profile. This can be done explicitly with the +stagingProfileId+ or
implicitly with groupId, artifactId and version. +stagingRepositoryId+
can also be part of projectInfo identifying a staging repository for
interaction.

connectionInfo:baseUrl:: The base URL of the Nexus server you want to
deploy to and interact with.

If necessary the +connectionInfo+ can have a nested +proxy+ section

----
<staging:proxy 
    host="proxy.mycorp.com" 
    port="8080">
  <staging:authentication 
      username="proxyUser" 
      password="proxySecret" />
</staging:proxy>
----

With the above setup you are ready to add a +deploy+ target to your
build file that stages the components locally as well as remotely and
closes the staging repository. 

----
<target name="deploy" description="Deploy: Local and Remote Staging">
  <staging:stageLocally>
    <staging:nexusStagingInfo 
        refid="target-nexus" />
      <fileset dir="target/local-repo" 
        includes="**/*.*" />
    </staging:stageLocally>

  <staging:stageRemotely>
    <staging:nexusStagingInfo 
        refid="target-nexus" />
  </staging:stageRemotely>
</target>
----

The folder +target/local-repo+ has to contain the components in a
directory structure resembling the Maven repository format using the
+groupId+, +artifactId+ and +version+ coordinates of the component
mapped to directory names. It will be merged into the target release
repository, when the staging repository is released. An example on how
to create such a structure in Ant can be found in the staging
example for Apache Ivy and Eclipse Aether in the
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples/[Nexus book examples
project].

Similarily, you can create a target that releases the staged components
by adding the +releaseStagingRepository+ task to the end of the target:

----
<staging:releaseStagingRepository>
  <staging:nexusStagingInfo 
      refid="target-nexus" />
</staging:releaseStagingRepository>
----

The stageLocally task takes a fileset as configuration. The
stageRemotely task has additional configuration options.

keepStagingRepositoryOnFailure:: Set to +true+ this causes the remote
staging repository to be kept rather than deleted in case of a failed
upload. Default setting is false

skipStagingRepositoryClose:: By default a staging repository is
automatically closed, setting this parameter to +true+ will cause the
staging repository to remain open.

In addition to the tasks for local and remote staging, the Nexus
staging Ant tasks include tasks for closing, dropping, releasing and
promoting a staging repository:

- closeStagingRepository

- dropStagingRepository

- releaseStagingRepository

- promoteStagingRepository

All these tasks take the context information from the local staging
directory or from the optional parameter `stagingRepositoryId`. The
task to promote a repository has the additional, mandatory attribute
`buildPromotionProfileId` to specify the build promotion profile to
promote.

The timing of the task operation can be affected by the following
configuration parameters:

stagingProgressTimeoutMinutes:: Defaulting to 5 minutes, this
configuration allows you to set the timeout for staging
operations. Changes are most often required for complex staging operations
involving custom staging rules or Nexus Lifecycle integration.

stagingProgressPauseDurationSeconds:: The default of 3 seconds can be
changed if larger pauses between progress polls for staging operations
are desired.

[[staging-deployment-maven-deploy-plugin]]
==== Deployment with the Maven Deploy Plugin

When using the Maven deploy plugin with the Nexus staging suite, you
rely on implicit matching of the components against a staging profile
based on a repository target definition. 

To deploy a staged release, a developer needs to deploy to the
staging URL. To configure a project to deploy to the staging URL, add
the a +distributionManagement+ element to your project's POM. 

[[ex-staging-dist-management]]
.Listing the Staging URL in distributionManagement
----
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
...
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <name>Nexus Staging Repo</name>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/</url>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
...
</project>
----

This configuration element, +distributionManagement+, defines the
repository to which our deployment will be made. It references the
staging suite's URL:
http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2

This URL acts as a virtual repository to be published
to.  If a component being published matches one of the repository
targets in a staging profile, that staging profile is 'activated' and
a temporary staging repository is created.

Once the sample project's +distributionManagement+ has been set
to point at the Nexus staging URL and your deployment credentials are
updated in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file, you can deploy to the staging
URL. To do this, run +mvn deploy+:

----

----

If the staging suite is configured correctly, any deployment to the
staging URL matching in a repository target configured for a staging
profile should be intercepted by the staging suite and placed in a
temporary staging repository. Deployment with the Maven deploy plugin
will not automatically close the staging repository. Closing the
staging repository has to be done with the Nexus user interface or the
Nexus staging Maven plugin.  Once this repository has been closed, it
will be made available in the target group you selected when you
configured the staging profile.


[[staging-gradle]]
==== Deployment and Staging with Gradle

The Gradle build system can be used to deploy components to Nexus with
the Gradle Maven plugin. The Nexus Staging Ant Tasks can be used in
Gradle allowing full inegration of the staging suite features in a
Gradle build. 

An example project showcasing this integration is available in the 
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples[Nexus book examples project]. 


[[staging-deployment-manual]]
==== Manually Uploading a Staged Deployment in Nexus

You can also upload a staged deployment via the Nexus interface. To
upload a staged deployment, select 'Staging Upload' from the 'Nexus'
menu. Clicking 'Staging Upload' will show the panel shown in
<<fig-staging-component-upload>>.

[[fig-staging-component-upload]]
.Uploading a Staged Deployment in Nexus
image::figs/web/staging_artifact-upload.png[scale=60]

To upload a component, click on 'Select Artifact(s) for Upload...' and
select an components from the filesystem to upload. Once you have
selected a component, you can modify the classifier and the extension
before clicking on the 'Add Artifact' button. Repeat this process to
upload mutltiple components for the same 'Group', 'Artifact' and 'Version'
(GAV) coordinates like a JAR, the POM and maybe a sources and javadoc
JAR in addition. Once you have added all the components, you can then
configure the source of the Group, Artifact, Version (GAV) parameters.

If the component you are uploading is a JAR file that was created by
Maven, it will already have POM information embedded in it, but if you
are uploading a JAR from a vendor you will likely need to set the
Group Identifier, Artifact Identifier, and Version manually. To do
this, select GAV Parameters from the GAV Definition drop-down at the
top of this form.  Selecting 'GAV Parameters' will expose a set of form
fields that will let you set the 'Group', 'Artifact', 'Version', and
'Packaging' of the components being uploaded. If you would prefer to set
the Group, Artifact, and Version from a POM file that was associated
with the uploaded component, select From POM in the GAV Definition
drop-down. Selecting From POM in this drop-down will expose a button
labeled 'Select POM to Upload'. Once a POM file has been selected for
upload, the name of the POM file will be displayed in the form field
below this button.

The 'Staging Upload' panel supports multiple components with the same
'Group', 'Artifact', and 'Version' identifiers. For example, if you need to
upload multiple components with different classifiers, you may do so by
clicking on 'Select Artifact(s) for Upload' and 'Add Artifact' multiple
times.  This interface also accepts an 'Artifact Bundle' which is a JAR
that contains more than one component, which is documented in more
detail in <<bundles>>.

Once a staging component upload has been completely configured, click
on Upload Artifact(s) button to begin the upload process. Nexus will
upload the components to the Staging URL which will trigger any staging
profiles that are activated by the upload by explicity matching using
the repository targets configured with the staging profiles. If a
staging profile is activated, a new staging repository will be created
and can be managed using the procedures outlined in
<<staging-repositories>>.


[[staging-repositories]]
=== Managing Staging Repositories in Nexus

With a staging profile configured and a deployment completed as
outlined in <<staging-configuration>> and
<<staging-deployment>>, you will have an automatically generated
staging repository. A list of all staging repositories can be
accessed by selecting the 'Staging Repositories' item in the 'Build
Promotion' menu and is displayed in <<fig-staging-repositories-list>>.

[[fig-staging-repositories-list]]
.Staging Repositories List Panel
image::figs/web/staging-repositories-list.png[scale=60]

Actions for the selected staging repository/ies in the list include options 
to 'Close', 'Promote', 'Release' or 'Drop'. The 'Refresh' button can be used
to force a reload of the list of repositories. The 'Filter by profile' 
drop-down allows you to select
one or multiple staging profiles from which the repositories in the
list were created. The list of repositories itself displays a number
of columns with details for each repository. Further columns can be
added by pressing on the drop-down triangle beside the currently
selected column. Sorting by a single column in 'Ascending' or
'Descending' order can be set from the same drop-down as the column
addition. 

NOTE: When triggering a transition for a staging repository from
e.g., the open state to a the closed state, a background task performs
all the necessary operations. Since these are potentially longer
running tasks, the user interface is not immediately updated. You 
are required to press 'Refresh' to get the latest state of all repositories.

By default the following columns are displayed:

Checkbox:: A checkbox to allow operations on multiple repositories.

Status Icon:: An icon symbolizing the status of the staging repository.

Repository:: The name of the staging repository.

Profile:: The name of the staging profile, that was used to create the
staging repository.

Status:: Status of the repository.

Updated:: Date and time of the last update.

Description:: Textual description of the repository.

Additional columns are:

Release To:: Target repository for the components in the staging
repository after release.

Promoted To:: The build promotion profile, to which a staging
repository was optionally promoted to.

Owner:: The username of the creator of the staging repository.

Created:: Date and time of the creation of the staging repository.

User Agent:: User agent string sent by the tool used for the
deployment, e.g., Apache-Maven/3.0.5. 

TIP: You can also access staging repositories in the 
list of repositories available in the 'Repositories' panel available
via the 'Views/Repositories' as a Nexus managed repository.

In the following sections, you will walk through the process of
managing staging repositories. Once you have deployed a set of related
components, you must close the repository moving it from an 'Open'
to a 'Closed' state unless the deployment tool automatically closed
the staging repository.

A repository in the 'Closed' state is added to a Repository Group and
is made available for testing purposes or other inspection and can no
longer received additional components in it.

When the component examination is complete, you can either
'Promote', 'Release', or 'Drop' the closed repository.

If the repository is dropped, the repository is discarded and removed
from the Repository Group and the components are move to the Trash.

If the repository is promoted, it is assigned to a build promotion
profile for further staging activities.

If the repository is released, its components are moved to the target
repository configured in the staging profile.

NOTE: A scheduled task documented in <<scheduled-tasks>>
can be used to clean up inactive staging repositories automatically.

Selecting a staging repository in the list displays further details about the
repository in the 'Summary', 'Activity', and 'Content' tabs below the
list. An example for an open repository is displayed in
<<fig-staging-repository-details>>.

[[fig-staging-repository-details]]
.List of Activities Performed on a Promoted Staging Repository
image::figs/web/staging-repository-details.png[scale=60]

The 'Summary' tab displays a number of properties of the staging
repository and allows you to edit the 'Description'.  The properties
include the name of the repository, created date/time and updated 
date/time, activity indicator, owner and originating IP number of
the deployment as well as the user agent string sent by the
deployment. All staging operations have a default description that is
used if the input field is left blank.

The 'Activity' tab shows all the activties that occured on a specific
staging repository. An example for a promoted repository is displayed
in <<fig-staging-repository-activity>>. The activities are separated
per activity and list all events that occurred in an acivity. Selecting
an event displays further details about the event on the right side of
the tab. 

[[fig-staging-repository-activity]]
.Details of an Open Staging Repository as Displayed under the List of Staging Repositories
image::figs/web/staging-repository-activity.png[scale=60]

The 'Content' tab displays a repository browser view of the staging repository
content and allows you to filter and display the components in the
tree view. Selecting a specific component triggers the display of
further panels with further information about the component, in the
same manner as other repository browser views. The tabs include Maven
and Artifact information and others.

For build promotion profile an additional 'Members' tab is shown. It
displays the source repositories and build promotion profiles from
which this current build promotion profile was created.

[[staging-sect-closing]]
==== Closing an Open Repository

Once you deploy a component that triggers a staging
profile, Nexus staging Suite will create a repository that contains the
components you deployed. A separate staging repository is created for
every combination of User ID, IP Address, and User Agent. This means
that you can perform more than one deployment to a single staging
repository, as long as you perform the deployment from the same IP with
the same deployment user and the same installation of Maven.

You can perform multiple deployments to an open staging
repository. Depending on the deployment tool and your configuration,
the staging repository might be automatically closed during deployment
or left open until manually closed.

Once you are ready to start testing the staging repository content, you
will need to transition the repository from the open state to
the closed state. This will close the staging repository to
more deployments. 

To close a repository, select the open staging repository in the list and
by clicking the checkbox in the list or anywhere else in the row. For
an open repository, the 'Close' and the 'Drop' buttons above the table
will be activated. Pressing the 'Close' button will bring up the
dialog for a staging deployer to describe the contents of the
staging repository and confirm . This description field can be used to pass
essential information to the person who needs to test a
deployment. 

In <<fig-staging-close-description>>, the description field is used to
describe the release for the user who needs to certify and promote a
release.

[[fig-staging-close-description]]
.Confirmation and Description Dialog for Closing a Staging Repository
image::figs/web/staging-repository-close-dialog.png[scale=60]

Confirming this state transition will close the repository and add the
repository to the repository groups configured in the staging
profile. The updated status will be visible in the list of staging
repositories after a 'Refresh', since the transition could take longer
depending on the configured staging rules and potential validation
against Nexus Lifecycle.

[[staging-sect-using-repository]]
==== Using the Staging Repository

Once the staging repository has been closed, it will automatically be
added to the repository group(s) that are specified as target groups
in the staging profile configuration.

This has the effect of making the staged components available to
everyone who is referencing this group.  Developers who are
referencing this repository group can now test and interact with the
staged components as if they were published to a Hosted repository.

While the components are made available in a repository group, the fact
that they are held in a temporary staging directory gives the staging
user the option of promoting this set of components to a hosted
repository. Alternatively, the user can drop this temporary staging
repository, if there are problems discovered during the testing and
certification process for a release.

Once a staging repository is closed, you can also browse and search
the repository in the staging repositories list.

To view all staging repositories, click on the
'Repositories' item in the 'Views/Repositories' menu and then select 'Nexus
Managed Repositories' as shown in <<fig-staging-selecting-nexus>>.

[[fig-staging-selecting-nexus]]
.Viewing Nexus Managed Repositories
image::figs/web/staging_select-nexus-managed.png[scale=60]

This list allows you to access all 'Nexus Managed Repositories', just
like the 'User Managed Repositories', including browsing the content and
accessing detailed information about the components in the
repository. In addition to staging repositories, the list included
procured repositories as documented in <<procure>>.

[[staging-sect-releasing]]
==== Releasing a Staging Repository

When you are finished testing or certifying the contents of a staging
repository, you are ready to either release, promote, or drop the staging
repository. Dropping the staging repository will delete the temporary
it from Nexus and remove any reference to this repository from the
groups with which it was associated.  Releasing the staging repository
allows you to publish the contents of this temporary repository to a
hosted repository. Promoting the repository will move it to a build
promotion profile.

You can release a staging repository by pressing 'Release', after
selecting a closed staging repository from the staging repositories
list. The 'Release Confirmation' dialog displayed in
<<fig-staging-repository-release-dialog>> will allow you to supply a
description and configure if the staging repository should be
automatically dropped after the components have been released to the
hosted repository.

[[staging-sect-promoting]]
==== Promoting a Staging Repository

If you have a closed staging repository that you want to promote to a
Build Promotion Profile, open the list of Staging Repositories and
click the 'Promote' button to bring up the 'Promote Confirmation'
dialog displaed in <<fig-staging-repository-release-dialog>>. It
allows you to select the build promotion profile to which you want to
stage the repository to as well as provide a description.

[fig-staging-repository-promote-dialog]]
.Confirmation Dialog for Promoting a Staging Repository
image::figs/web/staging-repository-promote-dialog.png[scale=60]

Clicking on the 'Promote' button in the dialog will promote the staging
repository to a build promotion repository and expose the contents of the
selected staging repository through the target group(s) associated
with the build promotion profile.

The build promotion repository is accessible in the staging repository
list as displayed in <<fig-staging-promotion-profile-members>>.  If
you add the column 'Promoted To' to the list you will observe that
Nexus keeps track of the promtion source. The 'Members' tab for a
build promotion repository displays the path of a build promotion
repository back to a staging repository. One or more staging
repositories can be promoted to a single build promotion profile.

[[staging-sect-using-build]]
==== Releasing, Promoting, and Dropping Build Promotion Profiles

When you configure a build promotion profile and promote staging
repositories to promotion profiles, each build promotion profile creates
a repository that contains one or more staging repositories. Just like
you can promote the contents of a staging repository to a build
promotion profile, you can also promote the contents of a build
promotion profile to another build promotion profile. When you do this
you can create hierarchies of staging repositories and build promotion
profiles that can then be dropped or released together.

[[fig-staging-build-promo-agg]]
.Releasing, Promoting, and Dropping Build Promotion Profiles
image::figs/web/staging-promotion.png[scale=60]

When you promote a staging repository to a build promotion
profile, you make the contents of a staging repository available via a
repository group associated with a build promotion profile. 

For example, if you staged a few components to a 'QA' staging repository
and then subsequently promoted that repository to a 'Closed Beta' build
promotion group, the contents of the 'QA' staging repository would
initially be made available via a 'QA' repository group. After a build
promotion, these components would also be available via a 'Closed Beta'
repository group.

You can take it one step further and promote the contents of the
'Closed Beta' build promotion profile to yet another build promotion
profile. In this way you can have an arbitrary number of intermediate
steps between the initial staging deployment and the final release.

If you drop the contents of a build promotion profile, you roll back
to the previous state. For example, if you decided to drop the
contents of the 'Closed Beta' build promotion group, Nexus will revert
the status of the staging repository from promoted to closed and make
the components available via the 'QA' staging repository. The effects of
promoting, dropping, and releasing components through a series of
staging profiles and build promotion profiles is shown in
<<fig-staging-build-promo-agg>>.

When you perform a release on a build promotion profile, it rolls up
to release all its members, ultimately reaching a staging
repository. Each staging repository releases its components to the
release repository configured in <<fig-staging-edit-profile>>.
Because a build repository can contain one or more promoted staging
repositories, this means that releasing a build promotion profile can
cause components to be published to more than one release repository.

[[fig-staging-multi-to-one]]
.Promoting Multiple Repositories to the Same Build Promotion Profile
image::figs/web/multiple-promotion-release.png[scale=60]

Build promotion profiles are not directly related to release
repositories, only staging profiles are directly associated with
target release repositories. <<fig-staging-multi-to-one>> illustrates
this behavior with two independent staging repositories, each
configured with a separate release repository. Releasing the build
promotion profile causes Nexus to publish each staging repository to a
separate hosted repository.

[[staging-sect-multi]]
==== Multilevel Staging and Build Promotion

Nexus also supports multilevel staging and build promotion. With
multilevel staging, a staging repository can be tested and then
promoted to multiple separate build promotion profiles consecutively
and exposed through different repository groups to allow for
additional testing and qualification before a final
frelease. <<fig-staging-multi-scenario>> illustrates a potential use
for multilevel staging:

Stage:: A developer publishes components to a QA staging profile that
exposes the staged components in a QA repository group used by an
internal quality assurance team for testing.

Promote to Beta:: Once the QA team has successfully completed
testing, they promote the temporary staging repository to a build
promotion profile that exposes the staged components to a limited
set of customers who have agreed to act as beta testers for a new
feature.

Release:: Once this 'Closed Beta' testing period is finished, the
staged repository is then released and the components it contains are
published to a hosted release repository and exposed via the public
repository group.

[[fig-staging-multi-scenario]]
.Multilevel Staging and Build Promotion
image::figs/web/multi-level-staging.png[scale=60]

To support this multilevel staging feature, you can configure Build
Promotion profiles as detailed in
<<staging-build-promotion-profile>>. Once you have promoted a
Staging Repository to a Build Promotion profile, you can drop,
promote, or release the components it contains as detailed in
<<staging-configuration>>.


[[staging-sect-rulesets]]
=== Enforcing Standards for Deployment and Promotion with Rulesets

Nexus has the ability to define staging rules that must be satisfied
to allow successful deployment or before a staging repository can be
promoted.

[[staging-rules]]
==== Managing Staging Rulesets

Staging rulesets are customizable groups of rules that are validated
against the components in a staging repository when the repository is
closed or promoted. If any rules cannot be validated, closing or
promoting the repository will fail.

A staging repository associated with a staging ruleset configured in
the staging profile cannot be closed or promoted until all of the
rules associated with the rulesets have been satisfied. This allows
you to set standards for your own hosted repositories, and it is the
mechanism that is used to guarantee the consistency of components
stored in the Central Repository.

To create a Staging Ruleset, click on the 'Staging Ruleset' item in
the 'Build Promotion' menu. This will load the interface shown in
<<fig-staging-rulesets>>.  The Staging Ruleset panel is used to define
sets of rules that can be applied to staging profiles.

[[fig-staging-rulesets]]
.Creating a Staging Ruleset
image::figs/web/staging-rulesets.png[scale=60]

Nexus contains the following rules:

Artifact Uniqueness Validation:: This rule checks to see that
the component being released, promoted, or staged is unique in a
particular Nexus instance.

Checksum Validation:: This rule validates that file checksum files are
present and correct for the published components.

Javadoc Validation:: The Javadoc Validation rule will
verify that every project has a component with the javadoc
classifier. If you attempt to promote a staging repository that
contains components not accompanied by "-javadoc.jar" components, this
validation rule will fail.

POM Validation:: The Staging POM Validation rule will verify
Project URL - project/url, Project Licenses - project/licenses and
Project SCM Information - project/scm. Any of these POM elements
cannot be missing or empty.

POM must not contain 'system' scoped dependencies:: Ensures that no
dependency is using the scope system. This allows for a path
definition ultimately making the component rely on a specific relative
path and using it is considered bad practice and violates the idea of 
having all necessary components available in repositories.

POM must not contain release repository:: This rule can ensure that
no repository element is defined in the POM. This is important since
it potentially would circumvent the usage of the repository manager
and could point to other repositories that are not actually available
to a user of the component

Signature Validation:: The Signature Validation rule
verifies that every item in the repository has a valid PGP
signature. If you attempt to promote a staging repository that
contains components not accompanied by valid PGP signature, this
validation will fail.

Sources Validation:: The Sources Validation rule will
verify that every project has a component with the sources
classifier. If you attempt to promote a staging repository that
contains components not accompanied by "-sources.jar" components, this
validation rule will fail.

[[staging-sect-defining-rulesets]]
==== Defining Rulesets for Promotion

To define a ruleset to be used for closing or promotion, edit the
staging profile by selecting it in the staging profile list. Scroll
down to the sections 'Close Repository Staging Rulesets' and 'Promote
Repository Staging Rulesets' as shown in
<<fig-staging-associate-ruleset>> and add the desired available
rulesets to the left-hand list of activated rulesets for the current
staging profile.

[[fig-staging-associate-ruleset]]
.Associating a Staging Ruleset with a Staging Profile
image::figs/web/staging-rulesets-associate.png[scale=60]

The next time you attempt to close or promote a staging repository
that was created with this profile, Nexus Pro will check that
all of the rules in the associated rulesets are being followed.


[[staging-clm]]
=== Policy Enforcement with Nexus Lifecycle

As discussed in <<concepts>>, epository management and managing 
components in your software development life cycle are closely 
related activities. The Nexus Lifecycle
suite of tools provides a server application for administrating your
component usage policies and other features that integrate with other
tools of the suite. It has access to extensive security vulnerability
and license information data from the Nexus Lifecycle backend that can
be used as input for your policies. For example you could establish a
policy that is logged as violated, if any component in your software
has a known security vulnerability or uses a license that is
incompatible with your business model.

Nexus Pro+ is an important component that can
take advantage of the Nexus Lifecycle server. The Nexus Lifecycle server can be
integrated to validate policies as part of your usage of the staging
suite of Nexus.

Detailed instructions on how to install and configure the Nexus Lifecycle
server as well as the integration in Nexus can be found in the
Nexus Lifecycle
http://links.sonatype.com/products/clm/doc[documentation].

[[bundles]]
=== Artifact Bundles

==== Introduction

Artifact bundles are groups of related components that are all related
by the same groupId, artifactId, and version (GAV) coordinate. They
are used by projects that wish to upload components to the 
Central Repository.

Bundles must contain the following POM elements:

* modelVersion
* groupId
* artifactId
* packaging
* name
* version
* description
* url
* licenses
* scm
** url
** connection

==== Creating an Artifact Bundle from a Maven Project

Artifact bundles are created with the Maven Repository Plugin. For
more information about the Maven Repository plugin, see
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-repository-plugin/[http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-repository-plugin/].

<<ex-bundles-sample-pom>> lists a project's POM that
satisfies all of the constraints that are checked by the Maven
Repository plugin. The following POM contains a description and a
URL, SCM information, and a reference to a license. All of this
information is required before a component bundle can be published to
the Maven Central repository.

To create a bundle from a Maven project, run the
repository:bundle-create goal. This goal will check the POM to see if
it complies with the standards for publishing a bundle to a public
repository. It will then bundle all of the components generated by
a particular build. To build a bundle that only contains the standard,
unclassified component from a project, run mvn
repository:bundle-create. To generate a bundle that contains more
than one component, run +mvn javadoc:jar source:jar
repository:bundle-create+:

[[bundles-sect-uploading]]
==== Uploading an Artifact Bundle to Nexus

To upload a component bundle to Nexus Pro, you have to have a
repository target for the project configured as described in
<<repository-targets>>. 

Once that is done, select 'Staging Upload' from the 'Build Promotion'
section of the 'Nexus' menu. This will load the 'Staging Upload'
tab. Choose 'Artifact Bundle' from the 'Upload Mode' drop-down. The
'Staging Upload' panel will switch to the form shown in
<<fig-bundles-staging-upload>>.  Click on 'Select Bundle to Upload...'
and then select the JAR that was created with the Maven repository
plugin used in the previous sections.  Once a bundle is selected,
click on 'Upload Bundle'.

[[fig-bundles-staging-upload]]
.Uploading an Artifact Bundle
image::figs/web/bundles-staging-upload.png[scale=60]

After a successful upload, a dialog displays the name of the created
staging repository in a URL that links to the content of the
repository. To view the staging repository, click on the 'Staging
Repositories' link in the 'Build Promotion' section of the Nexus menu. 
You should see that the 'Staging Artifact Upload' created and
closed a new staging repository as shown in
<<fig-bundles-staged-bundle>>. This repository contains all of the
components contained in the uploaded bundle. It allows you to promote
or drop the components contained in a bundle as a single unit.

[[fig-bundles-staged-bundle]]
.Staging Repository Created from Artifact Bundle Upload
image::figs/web/bundles-staged-bundle.png[scale=40]

Once the staging repository is closed, you can promote it to a Build
Promotion Profile or release it to the target repository of the
staging profile as documented in <<staging-repositories>>.
