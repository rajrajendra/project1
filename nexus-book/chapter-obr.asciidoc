== OSGi Bundle Repositories

[[osgi-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Nexus supports the OSGi Bundle Repository format. The
OSGi Bundle format is defined by the http://www.osgi.org/Download/File?url=/download/rfc-0112_BundleRepository.pdf[OSGi
RFC 112 "Bundle Repository."] It is a format for the
distribution of OSGi 'bundles' which includes any components that are
described by the OSGi standards set forth in RFC 112. An OBR
repository has a single XML file that completely describes the
contents of the entire repository.  Nexus Pro can read this
OBR repository XML and create proxy repositories that can download
OSGi bundles from remote OBR repositories.  Nexus Pro can
also act as a hosting platform for OSGi bundles. You can configure
your builds to publish OSGi bundles to Nexus Pro, and then
expose these bundle repositories to internal or external
developers using Nexus Pro as a publishing and distribution
platform.

Nexus Pro can also act as a bridge between Maven repositories
and OSGi bundle repositories. When you configure a virtual OBR
repository that uses a Maven 2 repository as a source repository,
Nexus Pro will expose components with the appropriate metadata
from the Maven repository as OSGi bundles. In this way, you can unify
your OSGi and non-OSGi development efforts and publish components with
the appropriate OSGi metadata to Nexus Pro. Non-OSGi clients
can retrieve software components from a Maven repository, and
OSGi-aware clients can retrieve OSGi bundles from a virtual OBR
repository.  

The following sections detail the procedures for creating and managing
OBR repositories.


Nexus Pro has OBR support installed by default.  Prior to any
usage in Nexus OSS the Nexus OBR Plugin needs to be installed. You can
download the +-bundle.zip+ file for your specific Nexus version from
the Central Repository:

* http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22nexus-obr-plugin%22%20AND%20l%3A%22bundle%22[Nexus OBR Plugin]

Extract the file into +sonatype-work/nexus/plugin-repository+ and
restart Nexus. Ensure to repeat the step for any Nexus upgrades.


[[osgi-sect-proxy]]
=== Proxy OSGi Bundle Repositories

Nexus can proxy an OSGi Bundle Repository using the OBR
repository XML as the remote storage location. To create a new proxy OBR
repository access the 'Repositories' view from the 'Views/Repositories' submenu
and click the 'Add..' button above the list of repositories and choose 'Proxy 
Repository' from the drop-down of repository types.

In the 'New Proxy Repository' configuration tab, supply a 'Repository ID' and
a 'Repository Name' and  select 'OBR' as the 'Provider'.

Then enter the URL to the remote repository OBR XML as the
'Remote Storage Location' and click 'Save'.

<<fig-obr-create-proxy>> provides a sample
configuration used to create a proxy of the Apache Felix OBR repository.

To verify that the OBR proxy repository has been properly
configured, you can then load the OBR XML from Nexus Pro. If
Nexus Pro is properly configured, you will be able load the
+obr.xml+ by navigating to the
+.meta+ directory:

$curl http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/felix-proxy/.meta/obr.xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='http://www2.osgi.org/www/obr2html.xsl'?>

              symbolicname='org.apache.felix.javax.servlet' 
    uri='../bundles/org.apache.felix.javax.servlet-1.0.0.jar' 
              version='1.0.0'>

[[osgi-sect-hosted]]
=== Hosted OSGi Bundle Repositories

Nexus can host an OSGi Bundle Repository, providing you
with a way to publish your own OBR bundles. To create a hosted OBR 
repository access the 'Repositories' view from the 'Views/Repositories' submenu
and click the 'Add..' button above the list of repositories and choose 'Hosted 
Repository' from the drop-down of repository types.

In the 'New Hosted Repository' configuration tab, supply a 'Repository ID' and
a 'Repository Name' and  select 'OBR' as the 'Provider'.

Then enter the URL to the remote repository OBR XML as the
'Remote Storage Location' and click 'Save'.

<<fig-obr-create-hosted>> provides some sample
configuration used to create a hosted OBR repository.

[[osgi-sect-virtual]]
=== Virtual OSGi Bundle Repositories

Nexus Pro can  be configured to convert a
traditional Maven repository into an OSGi Bundle repository using a
virtual OBR repository. To configure a virtual OBR repository, create 
a new 'Virtual Repository' in the 'Repositories' administration area providing 
a 'Repository ID' and 'Repository Name' as well as the 
'Source Nexus Repository ID' setting the repository you want to expose as OBR.
 Finally set the 'Provider' to 'OBR' and click 'Save'.
 
<<fig-obr-create-virtual>> provides a sample
configuration used to create a virtual OBR repository that transforms
the proxy repository for 'Maven Central' into an OBR repository.

[[osgi-sect-grouping]]
=== Grouping OSGi Bundle Repositories

Just like Nexus can group Maven repositories, Eclipse update
sites, and P2 repositories, Nexus can also be configured to group OSGi
Bundle Repositories. To group OSGi bundle repositories, create a 
new 'Repository Group' and set the 'Provider' to 'OBR' and select the 
repositories you want to group after providing a 'Group ID' and 
a 'Group Name'. 

<<fig-obr-create-group>> shows an example of the a
new repository group that contains a hosted OSGi Bundle repository, a
virtual OSGi Bundle repository, and a OSGi Bundle proxy repository.
