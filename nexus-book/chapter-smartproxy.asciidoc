== Nexus Smart Proxy 

=== Introduction

*Default is Polling*

Typically an organization runs a single Nexus instance to proxy
external components as well as host internally produced
components. When a build is running against this Nexus instance, it
will look for any new components in the proxied remote
repositories. This adds additional network traffic that in many cases
will just be a response from the remote server indicating that there
are no changes.

This polling approach is fine for smaller deployments. It will 
not result in immediately updated components as soon as they become
available upstream. In distributed teams with multiple Nexus
instances, this delay can result in build failures and delays. The
only way you are going to achieve that everything is up to
date is by setting expiration times to zero and constantly
polling.

*Smart Proxy Introduces Publish-Subscribe*

Increasingly, Nexus is used in globally distributed teams or used by
projects that span multiple organizations. In many cases, it is
advisable for each physical location to host its own Nexus
instance. This local instance hosts its own components and proxies the
other servers.

An example deployment scenario is displayed in
<<fig-smart-proxy-scenario>>. Using the traditional polling
approach, specifically when used with snapshot repositories, can
result in significant traffic and a performance hit for all involved
servers.

The 'Smart Proxy' feature replaces this constant polling approach with a
'Publish/Subscribe'-based messaging approach between Nexus instances
sharing a mutual trust. Once a component is published to a repository
a message is sent to all subscribing in the smart proxy message queue
that details the availability of new component. The subscribers
are therefore immediately aware of any new deployment and can provide
these components without having to poll the publishing server.

The result is a significantly improved performance due to nearly
immediate availability of upstream component information directly in
the downstream Nexus instances.

[[smartproxy-enabling_smart_proxy_publishing]]
=== Enabling Smart Proxy Publishing

In order to enable the smart proxy feature on your Nexus instance, you
need to navigate to the global 'Smart Proxy' configuration screen. It is
available in the left-hand navigation in the 'Enterprise'
section. Selecting 'Smart Proxy' will show you the configuration screen
displayed in <<fig-smart-proxy-global-config>>.
 
[[fig-smart-proxy-global-config]]
.Global Configuration for Smart Proxy

The 'Network Settings' section allows you to enable the smart proxy
server with a checkbox. This will need to be enabled on all servers
that publish events in the smart proxy network, while servers
that act only as subscribers can leave this option unchecked.

In addition, you can configure the address and port where the
publishing server will be available. The default address of 0.0.0.0
will cause the proxy to listen on all addresses. The default port
number of 0 will trigger usage of a random available port number for
connection listening. If a random port is used, it will be chosen when
the server (re)starts.

With the 'Advertised URI' field it is possible to configure a specific
address to be broadcasted by the proxy to the subscribing smart proxy
clients enabling, e.g., usage of a publicly available fully qualified
hostname, including the domain or also just the usage of an externally
reachable IP number.

IMPORTANT: It is important to configure the ports in Nexus and any
firewall between the servers to allow the direct socket connection
between the servers and to avoid using random ports.

The 'Status' field below the form will show the current status of the
smart proxy including the full address and port.

The 'Public Key' field displays the key identifying this server
instance. It is automatically populated with the certificate associated
with the public/private key pair that is generated when the server is
first run.

TIP: The key is stored in +sonatype-work/nexus/conf/keystore/private.ks+
and identifies this server. If you copy the sonatype work folder from
one server to another as part of a migration or a move from testing to
staging or production you will need to ensure that keys are not
identical between multiple servers. To get a new key generated, simply
remove the keystore file and restart Nexus.

[[smartproxy-establishing_trust]]
=== Establishing Trust

The servers publishing as well as subscribing to events identify
themselves with their public key. This key has to be registered with
the other servers in the 'Trusted Certificates' section of the 'Smart
Proxy' configuration screen.

To configure two Nexus repository servers as trusted smart proxies,
you copy the public key from the certificate of the other server
in the 'Trusted Certificates' configuration section by adding a new
trusted certificate with a meaningful description as displayed in
<<fig-smart-proxy-copy-certificate>> and
<<fig-smart-proxy-add-certificate>>.

All of the key generation and certificates related to the trust
management is handled by Nexus, itself and no external configuration
or usage of external keys is necessary.

[[smartproxy-repository_specific_smart_proxy_configuration]]
=== Repository Specific Smart Proxy Configuration

Once Smart Proxy has been configured and enabled as previously described,
you have to configure which repositories contents should be
proxied more efficiently between the servers. This is done in the 'Repositories'
administration interface in a separate configuration tab titled 'Smart
Proxy', which allows you to configure repository-specific details as
compared to server wide details described above.

On the publishing Nexus server you have to enable smart proxy on the
desired hosted, virtual or proxy repositories in the repository
configuration. This is accomplished by selecting the 'Publish Updates'
checkbox in the 'Publish' section of the 'Smart Proxy' configuration
for a specific repository as displayed in
<<fig-smart-proxy-repo-list-hosted>> and pressing save.

[[fig-smart-proxy-repo-list-hosted]]

On the Nexus instance subscribing to the publishing server you have to
create a new proxy repository to expose the proxied components. The
smart proxy configuration for this repository displayed in
<<fig-smart-proxy-repo-list-proxy>> allows you to activate the
'Receive Updates' checkbox in the 'Subscribe' configuration section.
With a working trust established between the publishing and
subscribing Nexus servers the Smart Proxy configuration of the proxy
repository on the subscribing Nexus will display connection status.

[[smartproxy-smart_proxy_security_and_messages]]
=== Smart Proxy Security and Messages

Smart Proxy messages are started with an initial handshake via
HTTP. This handshake allows the two server to exchange their keys and
confirm that they are configured with a valid trust relationship to
communicate. After a successful handshake, messages are sent in the
middleware layer and can be configured to be sent via SSL encrypted
messages. 
 
The following events are broadcasted via Smart Proxy.

- a new component has been deployed
- a component has been deleted
- a component has been changed
- repository cache or a part of it has been cleared
- Smart Proxy publishing has been disabled

On the recipient side this will cause the changes to be applied,
mimicking what happened on the publisher. If Smart Proxy is disabled the
subscription will be stopped.

[[smartproxy-example_setup]]
=== Example Setup

The deployment scenario displayed in <<fig-smart-proxy-scenario>> is a
typical use case for Smart Proxy. Component development is spread out
across four distributed teams located in New York, London, Bangalore
and San Jose. Each of the teams has a Nexus instance deployed in their
local network to provide the best performance for each developer team
and any locally running continuous integration server and other
integrations

[[fig-smart-proxy-scenario]]
.Deployment Scenario for a Smart Proxy Use Case
image::figs/web/smart-proxy-scenario.png[scale=50]

When the development team in New York does a commit to their component
build, a continuous integration server deploys a new component
snapshot version to the Nexus 1 instance.

With smart proxy enabled, this deployment is immediately followed by
notifications, sent to the trusted smart proxy subscribers in Nexus 2,
Nexus 3 and Nexus 4. These are collocated with the developers in
London, Bangalore, and San Jose and can be configured to immediately
fetch the new components available. At a minimum they will know about
the availability of new component versions without the need to poll
Nexus 1 repeatedly, therefore, keeping performance high for everyone. 

When a user of Nexus 2, 3 or 4 build a component that depends on a
snapshot version of the component from Nexus 1, smart proxy guarantees
that the latest version published to Nexus 1 is used. 

To configure smart proxy between these servers for the snapshots
repository you have to 

. add the public key of Nexus 1 as trusted certificate to Nexus 2, 3
  and 4

. add the public keys of Nexus 2, 3 and 4 as trusted certificate to Nexus 1

. enable smart proxy publishing on the snapshot repository on Nexus 1

. set up new proxy repositories to proxy the Nexus 1 snapshot
  repository on Nexus 2, 3 and 4

. enable smart proxy subscription on the new proxy repositories

. optionally enable prefetching of components

. add the new proxy repositories to the public group on Nexus 2, 3 and
  4

With this setup, any snapshot deployment from the New York team on
Nexus 1 is immediately available to the development team in London,
Bangalore, and San Jose.


[[smartproxy-advanced]]
=== Advanced Configuration

Typically smart proxy is configured in the dedicated user interfaces
provided and described earlier in this chapter. More fine grained and
advanced configuration is exposed in the capabilities administration
of Nexus documented in <<capabilities>>.

Specficically the following capabilities for the core smart proxy
features are automatically created and maintained.

Smart Proxy: Identity:: Provides the unique identity for the Nexus
server.

Smart Proxy: Messaging:: Provides the core messaging facilities for
smart proxy.

Smart Proxy: Trust:: Configures a trust relationsship with a remote
node.

Smart Proxy: Secure Connector:: Secures the connection using identity
and trust.

In addition you can find one smart proxy capabilities for all
repositories configured to be publish or subscribe updates with smart
proxy.

Smart Proxy: Publish:: Configures publishing updates to a specific
repository via smart proxy.

Smart Proxy: Subscribe:: Configures subscribing to updates for a
specific proxy repository. This capability exposes the additional
setting 'Delete' in the 'Settings' tab. If deletion is enabled, any
component deletions in the publishing repository is also carried out
in the subscribing repositories. The 'Preemptive Fetch' flag allows
you to enable a download of components to the susbscribing proxy
repository prior to any component requests received by it. The default
behaviour with preemptive fetch disabled only publishes the fact that
new components are available from the publishing repository.
