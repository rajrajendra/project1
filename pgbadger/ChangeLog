2014-10-07 version 6.2

This is a maintenance release to fix a regression in SQL traffic graphs and
fix some other minor issues.

The release also add a new option -D or --dns-resolv to map client ip addresses
to FQDN without having log_hostname enabled on the postgresql's configuration

	- Do not display queries in Slowest individual, Time consuming and
	  Normalized slowest queries reports when there is no duration in
	  log file. Display NO DATASET instead.
	- Fix min/max queries in SQL traffic that was based on duration instead
	  of query count.
	- Fix wrong unit to Synced files in Checkpoints files report. Thanks
	  to Levente Birta for the report.
	- Enable allow_loose_quotes in Text::CSV_XS call to fix CSV parsing
	  error when fields have quote inside an unquoted field. Thanks to
	  Josh Berkus for the report.
	- Add -D | --dns-resolv command line option to replace ip addresses
	  by their DNS name. Be warned that this can slow down pgBagder a lot.
	  Thanks to Jiri Hlinka for the feature request.

2014-09-25 version 6.1

This release fix some issues and adds some new features. It adds a new option
-B or --bar-graph to use bar instead of line in graphs. It will also keep tick
formatting when zooming.

The release also add a new program: pgbadger_tools to demonstrate how to
works with pgBadger binary files to build your own new feature. The first
tools 'explain-slowest' allow printing of top slowest queries as EXPLAIN
statements. There's also additional options to execute automatically the
statements with EXPLAIN ANALYZE and get the execution plan. See help of the
program for more information or the README file in the tools directory.

Some modifications will change certain behavior:

	- The -T | --title text value will now be displayed instead of the
	  pgBadger label right after the logo. It was previously displayed
	  on mouse over the pgBadger label.

Here is the full list of changes/fixes:

	- Change -T | --title position on pgBadger report. Title now override
	  the pgBadger label. Thanks to Julien Rouhauld for the patch.
	- Add --file-per-query and --format-query option to write each slowest
	  query in separate file named qryXXX.sql and perform minimal formating
	  of the queries. Thanks to Rodolphe Quiedeville for the patch.
	- Remove debug query from explain-slowest tool.
	- Fix surge in sessions number report when an exclusion or inclusion
	  option (dbname, user, appname, etc.) is used. Thanks to suyah for the
	  report.
	- Fix fatal error when remote log file is 0 size. Thanks to Julien
	  Rouhaud for the report.
	- Allow pgbadger_tools --explain-slowest to automatically execute the
	  EXPLAIN statements an report the plan. See pgbadger_tools --help for
	  more explanation.
	- Add --analyze option to replace EXPLAIN statements by EXPLAIN
	  (ANALYZE, VERBOSE, BUFFERS).
	- Move pgbadger_tools program and README.tools into the tools/
	  subdirectory with removing the extension. Add more comments and
	  explanations.
	- Fix case where die with interrupt signal is received when using -e
	  option. Thanks to Lloyd Albin for the report.
	- Add a new program pgbadger_tools to demonstrate how to deal with
	  pgBadger binary files to build your own new feature. The first one
	  'explain-slowest' allow printing of top slowest queries as EXPLAIN
	  statements.
	- Keep tick formatting when zooming. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the
	  patch.
	- Fix automatic detection of rsyslogd logs. Thanks to David Day for
	  the report.
	- Fix issue in calculating min/max/avg in "General Activity" report. It
	  was build on the sum of queries duration per minutes instead of each
	  duration. Thanks to Jayadevan M for the report.
	- The same issue remains with percentile that are build using the sum of
	  duration per minutes and doesn't represent the real queries duration.
	- This commit also include a modification in convert_time() method to
	  reports milliseconds.
	- Add -B or --bar-graph command line option to use bar instead of line
	  in graph. Thanks to Bart Dopheide for the suggestion.
	- Fix Checkpoint Wal files usage graph title.

2014-08-08 version 6.0

This new major release adds some new features like automatic cleanup of binary
files in incremental mode or maximum number of weeks for reports retention.
It improve the incremental mode with allowing the use of multiprocessing with
multiple log file.

It also adds report of query latency percentile on the general activity table
(percentiles are 90, 95, 99).

There's also a new output format: JSON. This format is good for sharing data
with other languages, which makes it easy to integrate pgBadger's result into
other monitoring tools.

You may want to expose your reports but not the data, using the --anonymize
option pgBadger will be able to anonymize all literal values in the queries.

Sometime select to copy a query from the report could be a pain. There's now
a click-to-select button in front of each query that allow you to just use
Ctrl+C to copy it on clipboard

The use of the new -X option also allow pgBadger to write out extra files to
the outdir when creating incremental reports. Those files are the CSS and
Javascript code normally repeated in each HTLM files.

Warning: the behavior of pgBadger in incremental mode has changed. It will now
always cleanup the output directory of all the obsolete binary file. If you were
using those files to build your own reports, you can prevent pgBadger to remove
them by using the --noclean option. Note that if you use the retention feature,
all those files in obsolete directories will be removed too.

Here is the complete list of changes.


	- Javascript improvement to use only one call of sql_select and
	  sql_format. Use jQuery selector instead of getElementById to
	  avoid js errors when not found. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the
	  patches.
	- Add -R | --retention command line option to set the maximum number of
	  week reports to preserve in the output directory for incremental mode.
	  Thanks to Kong Man for the feature request.
	- Session count is immediately decreased when a FATAL error is received
	  in the current session to prevent overcount of simultaneous session
	  number. Thanks to Josh Berkus for the report.
	- Fix issue in incremental mode when parsing is stopped after rotating
	  log and rotated log has new lines. The new file was not parsed at all.
	  Thanks to CZAirwolf for the report.
	- Fix revert to single thread when last_line_parsed exists. Thanks to
	  Bruno Almeida for the report.
	- Fix issue in handling SIGTERM/SIGINT that cause pgbadger to continue.
	- Add autoclean feature to pgbadger in incremental mode. pgbadger will
	  now removed automatically obsolete binary files unless you specify
	  --noclean at command line.
	- Add new command line option --anonymize to obscure all literals in
	  queries/errors to hide confidential data. Thanks to wmorancfi for the
	  feature request.
	- Fix single "SELECT;" as a query in a report. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the report.
	- Add a copy icon in front of each query in the report to select the
	  entire query. Thanks to Josh Berkus for the feature request.
	- Fix wrong move to beginning of a file if the file was modified after
	  have been parsed a time. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Allow pgBadger to write out extra files to outdir when creating
	  incremental reports. Require the use of the -X or --extra-files option
	  in incremental mode. Thanks to Matthew Musgrove for the feature request.
	- Fix incomplete handling of XZ compressed format.
	- Fix move to offset in incremental mode with multiprocess and incomplete
	  condition when file is smaller than the last offset. Thanks to Herve
	  Werner for the report.

	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix missing database name in samples of top queries reports. Thanks to
	  Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Add minimal documentation about JSON output format.
	- Add execute attribute to pgbadger in the source repository, some may
	  find this more helpful when pgbadger is not installed and executed
	  directly from this repository.
	- Fix issue with csv log format and incremental mode. Thanks to Suya for
	  the report and the help to solve the issue. There also a fix to support
	  autovacuum statistic with csv format.
	- Fix bad URL to documentation. Thanks to Rodolphe Quiedeville for the report.
	- Two minor change to made easier to use Tsung scenario: Remove the first
	  empty line and replace probability by weight. Now it is possible to use
	  the scenario as is with Tsung 1.5.
	- Fix incremental mode where weeks on index page start on sunday and week
	  reports start on monday. Thanks to flopma and birkosan for the report.
	- Replace label "More CPU costly" by "Highest CPU-cost". Thanks to Marc

2014-02-05 version 5.0

This new major release adds some new features like incremental mode and SQL
queries times histogram. There is also a hourly graphic representation of the
count and average duration of top normalized queries. Same for errors or events,
you will be able to see graphically at which hours they are occurring the most
often.

The incremental mode is an old request issued at PgCon Ottawa 2012 that concern
the ability to construct incremental reports with successive runs of pgBadger.
It is now possible to run pgbadger each days or even more, each hours, and have
cumulative reports per day and per week. A top index page allow you to go
directly to the weekly and daily reports.

This mode have been build with simplicity in mind so running pgbadger by cron
as follow:

	0 23 * * * pgbadger -q -I -O /var/www/pgbadger/ /var/log/postgresql.log

is enough to have daily and weekly reports viewable using your browser.

You can take a look at a sample report at http://dalibo.github.io/pgbadger/demov5/index.html

There's also a useful improvement to allow pgBadger to seek directly to the
last position in the same log file after a successive execution. This feature
is only available using the incremental mode or the -l option and parsing a
single log file. Let's say you have a weekly rotated log file and want to run
pgBadger each days. With 2GB of log per day, pgbadger was spending 5 minutes
per block of 2 GB to reach the last position in the log, so at the end of the
week this feature will save you 35 minutes. Now pgBadger will start parsing
new log entries immediately. This feature is compatible with the multiprocess
mode using -j option (n processes for one log file).

Histogram of query times is a new report in top queries slide that shows the
query times distribution during the analyzed period. For example:

	Range 		Count 		Percentage
	--------------------------------------------
	0-1ms		10,367,313	53.52%
	1-5ms		799,883		4.13%
	5-10ms		451,646		2.33%
	10-25ms		2,965,883	15.31%
	25-50ms		4,510,258	23.28%
	50-100ms	180,975		0.93%
	100-500ms	87,613		0.45%
	500-1000ms	5,856		0.03%
	1000-10000ms	2,697		0.01%
	> 10000ms	74		0.00%


There is also some graphic and report improvements, like the mouse tracker
formatting that have been reviewed. It now shows a vertical crosshair and
all dataset values at a time when mouse pointer moves over series. Automatic
queries formatting has also been changed, it is now done on double click
event as simple click was painful when you want to copy some part of the
queries.

The report "Simultaneous Connections" has been relabeled into "Established
Connections", it is less confusing as many people think that this is the number
of simultaneous sessions, which is not the case. It only count the number of
connections established at same time.

Autovacuum reports now associate database name to the autovacuum and autoanalyze
entries. Statistics now refer to "dbname.schema.table", previous versions was only
showing the pair "schema.table".

This release also adds Session peak information and a report about Simultaneous
sessions. Parameters log_connections and log_disconnections must be enabled in
postgresql.conf.

Complete ChangeLog:

	- Fix size of SQL queries columns to prevent exceeding screen width.
	- Add new histogram reports on top normalized queries and top errors
	  or event. It shows at what hours and in which quantity the queries
	  or errors appears.
	- Add seeking to last parser position in log file in incremental mode.
	  This prevent parsing all the file to find the last line parse from
	  previous run.  This only works when parsing a single flat file, -j
	  option is permitted. Thanks to ioguix for the kick.
	- Rewrite reloading of last log time from binary files.
	- Fix missing statistics of last parsed queries in incremental mode.
	- Fix bug in incremental mode that prevent reindexing a previous day.
	  Thanks to Martin Prochazka for the great help.

	  frequent queries (N).
	- Add vertical crosshair on graph.
	- Fix case where queries and events was not updated when using -b and
	  -e command line. Thanks to Nicolas Thauvin for the report.
	- Fix week sorting on incremental report main index page. Thanks to
	  Martin Prochazka for the report.
	- Add "Histogram of query times" report to show statistics like
	  0-100ms : 80%, 100-500ms :14%, 500-1000ms : 3%, > 1000ms : 1%.
	  Thanks to tmihail for the feature request.
	- Format mouse tracker on graphs to show all dataset value at a time.
	- Add control of -o vs -O option with incremental mode to prevent
	  wrong use.
	- Change log level of missing LAST_PARSED.tmp file to WARNING and
	  add a HINT.

	- Fix warning on META_MERGE for ExtUtils::MakeMaker < 6.46. Thanks
	  to Julien Rouhaud for the patch.
	- Add documentation about automatic incremental mode.
	- Add incremental mode to pgBadger. This mode will build a report
	  per day and a cumulative report per week. It also create an index
	  interface to easiest access to the different report. Must be run,
	  for example, as:
		pgbadger /var/log/postgresql.log.1 -I -O /var/www/pgbadger/
	  after a daily PostgreSQL log file rotation.
	- Add -O | --outdir path to specify the directory where out file
	  must be saved.
	- Automatic queries formatting is now done on double click event,
	  simple click was painful when you want to copy some part of the
	  queries. Thanks to Guillaume Smet for the feature request.
	- Remove calls of binmode to force html file output to be utf8 as
	  there is some bad side effect. Thanks to akorotkov for the report.

	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.

2013-10-31 - Version 4.0

This major release is the "Say goodbye to the fouine" release. With a full
rewrite of the reports design, pgBadger has now turned the HTML reports into
a more intuitive user experience and professional look.

The report is now driven by a dynamic menu with the help of the embedded
Bootstrap library. Every main menu corresponds to a hidden slide that is
revealed when the menu or one of its submenus is activated. There's
also the embedded font Font Awesome webfont to beautify the report.

Every statistics report now includes a key value section that immediately
shows you some of the relevant information. Pie charts have also been
separated from their data tables using two tabs, one for the chart and the
other one for the data.

Tables reporting hourly statistics have been moved to a multiple tabs report
following the data. This is used with General (queries, connections, sessions),
Checkpoints (buffer, files, warnings), Temporary files and Vacuums activities.

There's some new useful information shown in the key value sections. Peak
information shows the number and datetime of the highest activity. Here is the
list of those reports:

	- Queries peak
	- Read queries peak
	- Write queries peak
	- Connections peak
	- Checkpoints peak
	- WAL files usage Peak
	- Checkpoints warnings peak
	- Temporary file size peak
	- Temporary file number peak

Reports about Checkpoints and Restartpoints have been merged into a single report.
These are almost one in the same event, except that restartpoints occur on a slave
cluster, so there was no need to distinguish between the two.

Recent PostgreSQL versions add additional information about checkpoints, the
number of synced files, the longest sync and the average of sync time per file.
pgBadger collects and shows this information in the Checkpoint Activity report.

There's also some new reports:

	- Prepared queries ratio (execute vs prepare)
	- Prepared over normal queries
	- Queries (select, insert, update, delete) per user/host/application
	- Pie charts for tables with the most tuples and pages removed during vacuum.

The vacuum report will now highlight the costly tables during a vacuum or
analyze of a database.

The errors are now highlighted by a different color following the level.
A LOG level will be green, HINT will be yellow, WARNING orange, ERROR red
and FATAL dark red.

Some changes in the binary format are not backward compatible and the option
--client has been removed as it has been superseded by --dbclient for a long time now.

If you are running a pg_dump or some batch process with very slow queries, your
report analysis will be hindered by those queries having unwanted prominence in the
report. Before this release it was a pain to exclude those queries from the
report. Now you can use the --exclude-time command line option to exclude all
traces matching the given time regexp from the report. For example, let's say
you have a pg_dump at 13:00 each day during half an hour, you can use pgbadger
as follows:

	pgbadger --exclude-time "2013-09-.* 13:.*" postgresql.log 

If you are also running a pg_dump at night, let's say 22:00, you can write it
as follows:

	pgbadger --exclude-time '2013-09-\d+ 13:[0-3]' --exclude-time '2013-09-\d+ 22:[0-3]' postgresql.log 

or more shortly:

	pgbadger --exclude-time '2013-09-\d+ (13|22):[0-3]' postgresql.log 

Exclude time always requires the iso notation yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss, even if log
format is syslog. This is the same for all time-related options. Use this option
with care as it has a high cost on the parser performance.


2013-09-17 - version 3.6

Still an other version in 3.x branch to fix two major bugs in vacuum and checkpoint
graphs. Some other minors bugs has also been fixed.

	- Fix grammar in --quiet usage. Thanks to stephen-a-ingram for the report.
	- Fix reporting period to starts after the last --last-parsed value instead
	  of the first log line. Thanks to Keith Fiske for the report.
	- Add --csv-separator command line usage to documentation.
	- Fix CSV log parser and add --csv-separator command line option to allow
	  change of the default csv field separator, coma, in any other character.
	- Avoid "negative look behind not implemented" errors on perl 5.16/5.18.
	  Thanks to Marco Baringer for the patch.
	- Support timestamps for begin/end with fractional seconds (so it'll handle
	  postgresql's normal string representation of timestamps).
	- When using negative look behind set sub-regexp to -i (not case insensitive)
	  to avoid issues where some upper case letter sequence, like SS or ST.
	- Change shebang from /usr/bin/perl to /usr/bin/env perl so that user-local
	  (perlbrew) perls will get used.
	- Fix empty graph of autovacuum and autoanalyze.
	- Fix checkpoint graphs that was not displayed any more.


2013-07-11 - Version 3.5

Last release of the 3.x branch, this is a bug fix release that also adds some
pretty print of Y axis number on graphs and a new graph that groups queries
duration series that was shown as second Y axis on graphs, as well as a new
graph with number of temporary file that was also used as second Y axis.

	- Split temporary files report into two graphs (files size and number
	  of file) to no more used a second Y axis with flotr2 - mouse tracker
	  is not working as expected.
	- Duration series representing the second Y axis in queries graph have
	  been removed and are now drawn in a new "Average queries duration"
	  independant graph.
	- Add pretty print of numbers in Y axis and mouse tracker output with
	  PB, TB, GB, KB, B units, and seconds, microseconds. Number without
	  unit are shown with P, T, M, K suffix for easiest very long number
	  reading.
	- Remove Query type reports when log only contains duration.
	- Fix display of checkpoint hourly report with no entry.
	- Fix count in Query type report.
	- Fix minimal statistics output when nothing was load from log file.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix several bug in log line parser. Thanks to Den Untevskiy for the
	  report.
	- Fix bug in last parsed storage when log files was not provided in the
	  right order. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix orphan lines wrongly associated to previous queries instead of
	  temporary file and lock logged statement. Thanks to Den Untevskiy for
	  the report.
	- Fix number of different samples shown in events report.
	- Escape HTML tags on error messages examples. Thanks to Mael Rimbault
	  for the report.
	- Remove some temporary debug informations used with some LOG messages
	  reported as events.
	- Fix several issues with restartpoint and temporary files reports.
	  Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix issue when an absolute path was given to the incremental file.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Remove creation of incremental temp file $tmp_last_parsed when not
	  running in multiprocess mode. Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.


2013-06-18 - Version 3.4

This release adds lot of graphic improvements and a better rendering with logs
over few hours. There's also some bug fixes especially on report of queries that
generate the most temporary files.

	- Update flotr2.min.js to latest github code.
	- Add mouse tracking over y2axis.
	- Add label/legend information to ticks displayed on mouseover graphs.
	- Fix documentation about log_statement and log_min_duration_statement.
	  Thanks to Herve Werner for the report.
	- Fix missing top queries for locks and temporary files in multiprocess
	  mode.
	- Cleanup code to remove storage of unused information about connection.
	- Divide the huge dump_as_html() method with one method per each report.
	- Checkpoints, restart points and temporary files are now drawn using a
	  period of 5 minutes per default instead of one hour. Thanks to Josh
	  Berkus for the feature request.
	- Change fixed increment of one hour to five minutes on queries graphs
	  "SELECT queries" and "Write queries". Remove graph "All queries" as,
	  with a five minutes increment, it duplicates the "Queries per second".
	  Thanks to Josh Berkus for the feature request.
	- Fix typos. Thanks to Arsen Stasic for the patch.
	- Add default HTML charset to utf-8 and a command line option --charset
	  to be able to change the default. Thanks to thomas hankeuhh for the
	  feature request.
	- Fix missing temporary files query reports in some conditions. Thanks
	  to Guillaume Lelarge and Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Fix some parsing issue with log generated by pg 7.4.
	- Update documentation about missing new reports introduced in previous
	  version 3.3.

Note that it should be the last release of the 3.x branch unless there's major
bug fixes, but next one will be a major release with a completely new design.


2013-05-01 - Version 3.3

This release adds four more useful reports about queries that generate locks and
temporary files. An other new report about restart point on slaves and several
bugs fix or cosmetic change. Support to parallel processing under Windows OS has
been removed.

	- Remove parallel processing under Windows platform, the use of waitpid

	  and "Queries that waited the most". Thanks to Thomas Reiss for the
	  patch.
	- Add two reports about temporary files: "Queries generating the most
	  temporary files (N)" and "Queries generating the largest temporary

	  could be exactly the same than in log_line_prefix. Thanks to Cal
	  Heldenbrand for the report.
	- Fix perl documentation header, thanks to Cyril Bouthors for the patch.

2013-04-07 - Version 3.2

This is mostly a bug fix release, it also adds escaping of HTML code inside
queries and the adds Min/Max reports with Average duration in all queries
reports.

	- In multiprocess mode, fix case where pgbadger does not update
	  the last-parsed file and do not take care of the previous run.

	  future if hang with long queries still happen. Thanks to John
	  Rouillard for the report.
	- Fix an other issue in replacing bind param when the bind value
	  is alone on a single line. Thanks to Kjeld Peters for the report.
	- Fix parsing of compressed files together with uncompressed files
	  using the the -j option. Uncompressed files are now processed using

	- Force immediat die on command line options error.
	- Fix missing report of most frequent events/errors report. Thanks to
	  Vincent Laborie for the report.
	- Fix missing report of slowest normalized queries.  Thanks to Vincent
	  Laborie for the report.
	- Fix display of last print of progress bar when quiet mode is enabled.

2013-02-20 - Version 3.0

This new major release adds parallel log processing by using as many cores as
wanted to parse log files, the performances gain is directly related to the
number of cores specified. There's also new reports about autovacuum/autoanalyze
informations and many bugs have been fixed.

	- Update documentation about log_duration, log_min_duration_statement
	  and log_statement.
	- Rewrite dirty code around log timestamp comparison to find timestamp
	  of the specified begin or ending date.
	- Remove distinction between logs with duration enabled from variables
	  log_min_duration_statement and log_duration. Commands line options
	  --enable-log_duration and --enable-log_min_duration have been removed.
	- Update documentation about parallel processing.
	- Remove usage of Storable::file_magic to autodetect binary format file,
	  it is not include in core perl 5.8. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  report.
	- Force multiprocess per file when files are compressed. Thanks to
	  Julien Rouhaud for the report.
	- Add progress bar logger for multiprocess by forking a dedicated
	  process and using pipe. Also fix some bugs in using binary format
	  that duplicate query/error samples per process.
	- chmod 755 pgbadger
	- Fix checkpoint reports when there is no checkpoint warnings.
	- Fix non report of hourly connections/checkpoint/autovacuum when not
	  query is found in log file. Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the
	  report.
	- Add better handling of signals in multiprocess mode.
	- Add -J|--job_per_file command line option to force pgbadger to use
	  one process per file instead of using all to parse one file. Useful
	  to have better performances with lot of small log file.
	- Fix parsing of orphan lines with stderr logs and log_line_prefix
	  without session information into the prefix (%l).
	- Update documentation about -j | --jobs option.
	- Allow pgbadger to use several cores, aka multiprocessing. Add options
	  -j | --jobs option to specify the number of core to use.
	- Add autovacuum and autoanalyze infos to binary format.

	- Fix issue with Perl 5.16 that do not allow "ss" inside look-behind
	  assertions. Thanks to Cedric for the report.
	- New vacuum and analyze hourly reports and graphs. Thanks to Guillaume
	  Lelarge for the patch.

UPGRADE: if you are running pgbadger by cron take care if you were using one of
the following option: --enable-log_min_duration  and --enable-log_duration, they
have been removed and pgbadger will refuse to start.

2013-01-17 - Version 2.3

This release fixes several major issues especially with csvlog and a memory leak
with log parsing using a start date. There's also several improvement like new
reports of number of queries by database and application. Mouse over reported
queries will show database, user, remote client and application name where they
are executed.

A new binary input/output format have been introduced to allow saving or reading
precomputed statistics. This will allow incremental reports based on periodical
runs of pgbader. This is a work in progress fully available with next coming
major release.

Several SQL code beautifier improvement from pgFormatter have also been merged.

	- Clarify misleading statement about log_duration: log_duration may be
	  turned on depending on desired information. Only log_statement must
	  not be on. Thanks to Matt Romaine for the patch.
	- Fix --dbname and --dbuser not working with csvlog format. Thanks to
	  Luke Cyca for the report.
	- Fix issue in SQL formatting that prevent left back indentation when
	  major keywords were found. Thanks to Kevin Brannen for the report.
	- Display 3 decimals in time report so that ms can be seen. Thanks to
	  Adam Schroder for the request.
	- Force the parser to not insert a new line after the SET keyword when
	  the query begin with it. This is to preserve the single line with
	  queries like SET client_encoding TO "utf8";
	- Add better SQL formatting of update queries by adding a new line
	  after the SET keyword. Thanks to pilat66 for the report.
	- Update copyright and documentation.
	- Queries without application name are now stored under others
	  application name.
	- Add report of number of queries by application if %a is specified in
	  the log_line_prefix.
	- Add link menu to the request per database and limit the display of
	  this information when there is more than one database.
	- Add report of requests per database.
	- Add report of user,remote client and application name to all request
	  info.
	- Fix memory leak with option -b (--begin) and in incremental log
	  parsing mode.
	- Remove duration part from log format auto-detection. Thanks to
	  Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix a performance issue on prettifying SQL queries that makes pgBagder
	  several time slower that usual to generate the HTML output. Thanks to
	  Vincent Laborie for the report.
	- Add missing SQL::Beautify paternity.
	- Add 'binary' format as input/output format. The binary output format
	  allows to save log statistics in a non human readable file instead of
	  an HTML or text file. These binary files might then be used as regular
	  input files, combined or not, to produce a html or txt report. Thanks
	  to Jehan Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Remove port from the session regex pattern to match all lines.
	- Fix the progress bar. It was trying to use gunzip to get real file
	  size for all formats (by default). Unbreak the bz2 format (that does
	  not report real size) and add support for zip format. Thanks to Euler
	  Taveira de Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Fix some typos and grammatical issues. Thanks to Euler Taveira de
	  Oliveira fort the patch.
	- Improve SQL code highlighting and keywords detection merging change
	  from pgFormatter project.
	- Add support to hostname or ip address in the client detection. Thanks
	  to stuntmunkee for the report.
	- pgbadger will now only reports execute statement of the extended
	  protocol (parse/bind/execute). Thanks to pierrestroh for the report.
	- Fix numerous typos as well as formatting and grammatical issues.
	  Thanks to Thom Brown for the patch.
	- Add backward compatibility to obsolete --client command line option.
	  If you were using the short option -c nothing is changed.

	  Rouhaud for the patch.
	- Fix multiline progress bar output.
	- Allow usage of a dash into database, user and application names when
	  prefix is used. Thanks to Vipul for the report.
	- Mouse over queries will now show in which database they are executed
	  in the overviews (Slowest queries, Most frequent queries, etc. ).
	  Thank to Dirk-Jan Bulsink for the feature request.
	- Fix missing keys on %cur_info hash. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  report.
	- Move opening file handle to log file into a dedicated function.
	  Thanks to Marc Cousin for the patch.
	- Replace Ctrl+M by printable \r. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the report.


2012-11-13 - Version 2.2

This release add some major features like tsung output, speed improvement with
csvlog, report of shut down events, new command line options to generate report
excluding some user(s), to build report based on select queries only, to specify
regex of the queries that must only be included in the report and to remove
comments from queries. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade.

	- Update PostgreSQL keywords list for 9.2
	- Fix number of queries in progress bar with tsung output.
	- Remove obsolete syslog-ng and temporary syslog-ll log format added to
	  fix some syslog autodetection issues. There is now just one syslog
	  format: syslog, differences between syslog formats are detected and
	  the log parser is adaptive.
	- Add comment about the check_incremental_position() method
	- Fix reports with empty graphs when log files were not in chronological
	  order.
	- Add report of current total of queries and events parsed in progress
	  bar. Thanks to Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais for the patch.
	- Force pgBadger to use an require the XS version of Text::CSV instead
	  of the Pure Perl implementation. It is a good bit faster thanks to
	  David Fetter for the patch. Note that using csvlog is still a bit
	  slower than syslog or stderr log format.
	- Fix several issue with tsung output.
	- Add report of shut down events
	- Add debug information on command line used to pipe compressed log
	  file when -v is provide.
	- Add -U | --exclude-user command line option to generate report
	  excluded user. Thanks to Birta Levente for the feature request.
	- Allow some options to be specified multiple time or be written as a
	  coma separated list of value, here are these options: --dbname,
	  --dbuser, --dbclient, --dbappname, --exclude_user.
	- Add -S | --select-only option to build report only on select queries.
	- Add first support to tsung output, see usage. Thanks to Guillaume
	  Lelarge for the feature request.
	- Add --include-query and --include-file to specify regex of the queries
	  that must only be included in the report. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the feature request.
	- Fix auto detection of log_duration and log_min_duration_statement
	  format.
	- Fix parser issue with Windows logs without timezone information.
	  Thanks to Nicolas Thauvin for the report.
	- Fix bug in %r = remote host and port log line prefix detection.
	  Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski for the report.
	- Add -C | --nocomment option to remove comment like /* ... */ from
	  queries. Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski for the feature request.
	- Fix escaping of log_line_prefix. Thanks to Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski
	  for the patch.
	- Fix wrong detection of update queries when a query has a object names
	  containing update and set. Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.

2012-10-10 - Version 2.1

This release add a major feature by allowing any custom log_line_prefix to be
used by pgBadger. With stderr output you at least need to log the timestamp (%t)
the pid (%p) and the session/line number (%l). Support to log_duration instead
of log_min_duration_statement to allow reports simply based on duration and
count report without query detail and report. Lot of bug fixes, please upgrade
asap.

	- Add new --enable-log_min_duration option to force pgbadger to use lines
	  generated by the log_min_duration_statement even if the log_duration
	  format is autodetected. Useful if you use both but do not log all queries.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Add syslog-ng format to better handle syslog traces with notation like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. It is autodetected but can be forced in the -f option
	  with value set to: syslog-ng.
	- Add --enable-log_duration command line option to force pgbadger to only
	  use the log_duration trace even if log_min_duration_statement traces are
	  autodetected.
	- Fix display of empty hourly graph when no data were found.
	- Remove query type report when log_duration is enabled.
	- Fix a major bug in query with bind parameter. Thanks to Marc Cousin for
	  the report.
	- Fix detection of compressed log files and allow automatic detection
	  and uncompress of .gz, .bz2 and .zip files.
	- Add gunzip -l command to find the real size of a gzip compressed file.
	- Fix log_duration only reports to not take care about query detail but
	  just count and duration.
	- Fix issue with compressed csvlog. Thanks to Philip Freeman for the
	  report.
	- Allow usage of log_duration instead of log_min_duration_statement to
	  just collect statistics about the number of queries and their time.
	  Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the feature request.
	- Fix issue on syslog format and autodetect with additional info like:
	  [ID * local2.info]. Thanks to kapsalar for the report.
	- Removed unrecognized log line generated by deadlock_timeout.
	- Add missing information about unsupported csv log input from stdin.
	  It must be read from a file. Thank to Philip Freeman for the report.
	- Fix issue #28: Illegal division by zero with log file without query
	  and txt output. Thanks to rlowe for the report.
	- Update documentation about the -N | --appname option.
	- Rename --name option into --appname. Thanks to Guillaume Lellarge for
	  the patch.
	- Fix min/max value in xasis that was always represented 2 days by
	  default. Thanks to Casey Allen Shobe for the report.
	- Fix major bug when running pgbadger with the -e option. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the report and the great help
	- Change project url to http://dalibo.github.com/pgbadger/. Thanks to
	  Damien Clochard for this new hosting.
	- Fix lot of issues in CSV parser and force locale to be C. Thanks to
	  Casey Allen Shobe for the reports.
	- Improve speed with custom log_line_prefix.
	- Merge pull request #26 from elementalvoid/helpdoc-fix
	- Fixed help text for --exclude-file. Old help text indicated that the
	  option name was --exclude_file which was incorrect.
	- Remove the obsolete --regex-user and --regex-db options that was used
	  to specify a search pattern in the log_line_prefix to find the user
	  and db name. This is replaced by the --prefix option.
	- Replace Time column report header by Hour.
	- Fix another issue in log_line_prefix parser with stderr format
	- Add a more complex example using log_line_prefix
	- Fix log_line_prefix issue when using timepstamp with millisecond.
	- Add support to use any custom log_line_prefix with new option -p or
	  --prefix. See README for an example.
	- Fix false autodetection of CSV format when log_statement is enable or
	  in possible other cases. This was resulting in error: "FATAL: cannot
	  use CSV". Thanks to Thomas Reiss for the report.
	- Fix display of empty graph of connections per seconds
	- Allow character : in log line prefix, it will no more break the log
	  parsing. Thanks to John Rouillard for the report.
	- Add report of configuration parameter changes into the errors report
	  and change errors report by events report to handle important messages
	  that are not errors.
	- Allow pgbadger to recognize " autovacuum launcher" messages.

2012-08-21 - version 2.0

This major version adds some changes not backward compatible with previous
versions. Options -p and -g are not more used as progress bar and graphs
generation are enabled by default now.

The obsolete -l option use to specify the log file to parse has been reused to
specify an incremental file. Outside these changes and some bug fix there's
also new features:

    * Using an incremental file with -l option allow to parse multiple time a
      single log file and to "seek" at the last line parsed during the previous
      run. Useful if you have a log rotation not sync with your pgbadger run.
      For exemple you can run somthing like this:

	pgbadger `find /var/log/postgresql/ -name "postgresql*" -mtime -7 -type f` \
	    -o report_`date +%F`.html -l /var/run/pgbadger/last_run.log

    * All queries diplayed in the HTML report are now clickable to display or
      hide a nice SQL query format. This is called SQL format beautifier.

    * CSV log parser have been entirely rewritten to handle csv with multiline.

Every one should upgrade.

  First public release of pgBadger.

    New feature:

	- Add graph of ckeckpoint Wal files usage (added, removed, recycled).
	- Add --image-format to allow the change of the default png image
	  format to jpeg.

	  Default filename is out.html or out.txt following the output format.
	  To dump to stdout set filename to -

    Bug fix:

	- Rearrange x and y axis
	- Fix legend opacity on graphics
	- Rearrange Overall stats view
